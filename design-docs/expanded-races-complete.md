## 🏰 HUMANS — The Builders
**Homeland:** The Verdant Heartlands (5 towns)
**Government:** Feudal Monarchy (elected King, appointed nobles)
**Population Rank:** #1 — Most numerous race in Aethermere

### Lore
Humans are the most adaptable and ambitious race. They lack the specialization 
of other races but compensate with versatility, numbers, and raw determination. 
The Heartlands are the political and economic center of the continent — a 
breadbasket of fertile plains and thriving cities. Humans build empires, 
and their kingdoms have risen and fallen more times than any scholar can count.

**Homeland:** The Silverwood Forest (5 towns)

### Lore
The Elves have inhabited Silverwood since before human memory. Deeply connected 
to nature, magic, and the arcane currents of the land, they are master archers,

condescension — what can a creature that lives 80 years truly understand?

**Population Rank:** #4 — Clannish, concentrated in mountain holds

### Lore
Dwarves carved their civilization into the bones of the Ironvault Mountains. 
Their underground cities are vast complexes of halls, forges, and mines 
illuminated by magma and phosphorescent crystals. Dwarven craftsmanship is 
the gold standard — a Dwarven blade is worth three Human-made ones. Their 
eternal foes are the Orcs of Ashenfang.

### Stats

**Government:** Town Councils (direct democracy)
**Population Rank:** #3 — Spread everywhere, concentrated at Crossroads

### Lore
Halflings occupy the most strategically valuable land — the Crossroads, where 
every major trade route intersects. They have an uncanny knack for deals that 
benefit everyone (especially themselves). Small in stature, enormous in influence. 
The wealthiest merchants, shrewdest bankers, best cooks, and sneakiest rogues 
all tend to be Halflings.

## ⚔️ ORCS — The Warborn
**Homeland:** The Ashenfang Wastes (5 towns)
**Government:** Warchief (strongest leads, challengeable by combat)
**Population Rank:** #2 — Aggressive expansion, large clans

### Lore
Forged by hardship in the brutal Ashenfang Wastes. Orc society is built on 
strength, combat honor, and the clan. The Warchief rules by being the most 
powerful — anyone can challenge through ritual combat. Often misunderstood as 
brutes, but their warriors are tactically brilliant and their shamans command 
powerful primal magic. Eternal enemies of the Dwarves.

### Stats

## 😈 TIEFLINGS — The Outcasts
**Homeland:** Shadowmere Marshes (5 towns)
**Government:** Shadow Council (ruled by secrets and influence)
**Population Rank:** #7 (Core) — Small, distrusted, tight-knit

### Lore
Bearing the mark of infernal heritage — horns, tails, unusual eyes — Tieflings 
face prejudice everywhere. Driven from civilized lands generations ago, they 
found refuge in the Shadowmere Marshes. They've mastered alchemy, dark magic, 
and the art of surviving where others won't go. Their society runs on information — 
secrets are currency.

**Government:** Clan Elders + Dragon Oracle
**Population Rank:** #8 (Core) — Rarest of the core races

### Lore
Claiming descent from the great dragons, Dragonborn have scaled skin, breath 
weapons, and imposing stature. They inhabit the Frozen Reaches — glacial tundra 
and volcanic peaks. Divided into clans by dragon color and element. Rare, 
respected, and feared.

## 🧝 HALF-ELVES — The Bridge Between Worlds
**Homeland:** Shared — settlements in both Heartlands and Silverwood borders
**Territory:** 3 towns along the Human-Elf border (The Twilight March)
**Government:** Elected Magistrates (blend of Human democracy and Elven wisdom)
**Population Rank:** #6

### Lore
Born of Human ambition and Elven grace, Half-Elves belong fully to neither world. 
Too short-lived for Elven patience, too fey for Human practicality. But this 
dual nature is their greatest strength — they are natural diplomats, translators 
between cultures, and bridges across racial divides. The Twilight March, the 
borderland between Heartlands and Silverwood, has become their unofficial home — 
a place where both heritages meet.

### Stats
| STR | DEX | CON | INT | WIS | CHA |
|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|
| +0  | +2  | +1  | +1  | +1  | +3  |
**Trait: Dual Heritage** — Exceptional charisma and social grace, balanced stats.

| 1 | Fey Ancestry | Passive | Immune to magical sleep, advantage on charm saves |
| 5 | Cultural Ambassador | Passive | Racial relation penalties reduced by 50% everywhere |
| 10 | Inspiring Presence | Active (12hr CD) | All party members +1 to all rolls for 30 min |

## 💪 HALF-ORCS — The Proving
**Homeland:** Shared — settlements on Orc-Human borders
**Territory:** 3 towns in the Contested Borderlands (The Scarred Frontier)
**Government:** Merit Council (prove your worth through deeds, not blood)
**Population Rank:** #9

### Lore
Half-Orcs carry the strength of Orcs and the adaptability of Humans, but the 
acceptance of neither. Too gentle for Orc warbands, too savage for Human courts. 
The Scarred Frontier — the war-torn border between Ashenfang and the Heartlands — 
became their home by necessity. Here, what you DO matters more than what you ARE. 
Half-Orcs have built a culture that values proving oneself through action. Many 
become legendary mercenaries, monster hunters, or surprisingly, master craftsmen 
who combine Orcish raw materials expertise with Human technique.

### Stats
| STR | DEX | CON | INT | WIS | CHA |
|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|
| +3  | +1  | +2  | +0  | +1  | +0  |

| 25 | Proven Warrior | Passive | +15% XP from combat, +10% from crafting |
| 40 | Unstoppable Force | Active (24hr CD) | Next 3 attacks automatically hit (no roll needed) |

### Profession Bonuses

- +15% blacksmithing quality (combine raw power with technique)
- +15% tanning quality
- +10% mining yield
- Best as: **Mercenaries, Hunters, Blacksmiths, Monster Hunters**

## 🧙 GNOMES — The Tinkerers
**Homeland:** The Cogsworth Warrens (hidden among the Ironvault foothills)
**Territory:** 3 towns in hillside burrows near Dwarven territory
**Government:** The Innovation Council (led by whoever invented the most useful thing this year)
**Population Rank:** #10

### Lore
Where Dwarves see stone and forge iron, Gnomes see possibilities. These small, 
endlessly curious people live in elaborate burrow-cities filled with clockwork 
mechanisms, alchemical experiments, and at least one thing that's currently on 
fire. Gnomes are the engineers and mad scientists of Aethermere. Their inventions 
range from the brilliantly useful (clockwork water pumps, spring-loaded mining 
tools) to the spectacularly disastrous (the less said about the Gnomish Aerial 
Velocipede, the better). They get along well with Dwarves (who appreciate their 
craftsmanship if not their chaos) and Halflings (kindred small folk with shared 
business sense).

### Stats
| STR | DEX | CON | INT | WIS | CHA |
|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|
| -2  | +2  | +1  | +4  | +1  | +1  |
**Trait: Inventive Mind** — Brilliant intellect, tiny stature.

| 10 | Efficient Engineering | Passive | Crafting uses 10% fewer materials |
| 15 | Clockwork Companion | Active | Summon a clockwork helper: +10% gather/craft speed for 2 hours (8hr CD) |
| 25 | Eureka Moment | Active (24hr CD) | Instantly complete one crafting project in progress |

- +15% jeweling precision
- +15% scribe quality
- +10% all crafting speed

## 🌊 MERFOLK — The Tideborn
**Homeland:** The Pelagic Depths (underwater settlements off the Suncoast)
**Territory:** 3 coastal/underwater settlements
**Government:** Tidal Parliament (representatives from each coral city)
**Population Rank:** #13

### Lore
The Merfolk have existed beneath the waves since before land-dwellers built their 
first huts. Part humanoid, part aquatic, they can breathe both air and water — 
though they're far more comfortable in the sea. For most of history, Merfolk kept 
to themselves. But the expansion of surface trade routes, overfishing, and the 
occasional sunken treasure dispute have drawn them into the affairs of the land. 
Merfolk on the surface walk on two legs (their tails split in air) but move slower 
than other races on land. In water, they're unmatched. They bring unique oceanic 
resources — deep sea ores, pearls, coral, rare aquatic herbs — that no surface 
race can gather.

### Stats
| STR | DEX | CON | INT | WIS | CHA |
|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|
| +1  | +2  | +2  | +0  | +2  | +1  |
**Trait: Amphibious** — Can breathe water and air. Excels in water, slower on land.

### Racial Abilities

|-------|---------|------|--------|
| 1 | Waterborne | Passive | Swim speed 3x land speed, access underwater resource nodes |
| 5 | Tidal Healing | Active (4hr CD) | When in water, heal 25% of max HP over 1 minute |
| 10 | Depth Pressure | Passive | +20% yield on underwater gathering (deep sea ore, pearls, coral) |
| 15 | Aquatic Camouflage | Passive | Invisible while submerged and stationary (PvP advantage near water) |
| 25 | Call of the Deep | Active (24hr CD) | Summon a water elemental companion for 1 combat encounter |
| 40 | Tsunami Strike | Active (1/combat) | Massive water AoE: 3d8 damage, all enemies knocked prone |

### Profession Bonuses

- +30% pearl and coral gathering (exclusive access to deep nodes)
- +20% alchemy with aquatic ingredients
- +15% enchanting with water-element magic
- -15% land gathering speed (slower on land)
- Best as: **Fishermen, Pearl Divers (unique), Alchemists, Enchanters (water)**

### Special Mechanic: Underwater Zones
Merfolk unlock access to **underwater resource nodes** that no other race can reach 
without expensive magical gear. This includes: Deep Sea Iron, Abyssal Pearls, 
Living Coral, Sea Silk, Leviathan Bone, and Tideweave Kelp. These are exotic 
crafting materials that command premium prices on land.

### Homeland Towns
| Town | Type | Specialty |
|------|------|-----------|
| Coralspire | Capital (Underwater) | Politics, Pearl Markets |
| Shallows End | Coastal (Half-submerged) | Trade with surface, fishing |

## 🦊 BEASTFOLK (Lycans) — The Wildborn
**Homeland:** The Thornwilds (untamed wilderness between regions)
**Territory:** 3 settlements in deep wilderness
**Government:** Pack Alphas (strongest and wisest lead, but packs are democratic)
**Population Rank:** #11

### Lore
Beastfolk — often called Lycans by outsiders — are humanoids with pronounced 
animal features: fur, claws, tails, ears, heightened senses. They are NOT 
lycanthropes (that's a curse; this is a race). Different clans take after 
different animals: Wolf, Bear, Fox, Hawk, Panther, Boar. They live in the 
Thornwilds, the untamed wilderness between civilized regions where nature is 
still wild and dangerous. Beastfolk are the ultimate survivalists — hunters, 
trackers, and rangers without equal. They distrust civilization's walls and 
laws, preferring the honest danger of the wild to the hidden dangers of politics.

### Sub-Race: Animal Clan (Choose at Creation)
| Clan | Bonus Stat | Special Perk |
|------|-----------|-------------|
| Wolf | +1 DEX | Pack Tactics: +2 attack when ally is adjacent |
| Bear | +1 CON | Thick Hide: +1 natural AC |

**Trait: Primal Instinct** — Physically gifted with supernatural senses, but distrustful of arcane.

### Racial Abilities

## 🌸 FAEFOLK (Pixies/Sprites) — The Fey Touched
**Homeland:** The Glimmerveil (a pocket realm accessible through Silverwood)
**Territory:** 2 towns in the Feywild border zone + 1 in Silverwood
**Government:** The Seelie Court (ruled by seasonal monarchs who rotate power)
**Population Rank:** #14

### Lore
Faefolk are small (2-3 feet tall), winged humanoids from the border between the 
mortal world and the Feywild — a parallel realm of wild magic, eternal twilight, 
and capricious spirits. They are creatures of pure magic: mischievous, emotional, 
and impossibly powerful for their size. Their moods shift like weather, their 
promises are binding magical contracts, and their pranks range from harmless to 
devastating. Faefolk don't fully understand mortal concepts like "property" or 
"death" — they find both confusing and a little sad. Playing as Faefolk is the 
game's "hard mode" for social and economic play — they're amazing at magic but 
terrible at conventional crafting and politics.

unique resources (Moonpetal Flowers, Dreamweave Silk, Starlight Dust, Fey Iron) 
that can only be gathered there. Other races can enter if a Faefolk opens the portal, 
but they suffer disorientation penalties. Fey materials make the most powerful 
enchanting components in the game.

## 🪨 GOLIATHS — The Stonekin
**Homeland:** The Skypeak Plateaus (extreme high altitude above the Ironvault)
**Territory:** 2 settlements on mountain peaks too harsh for even Dwarves
**Government:** Tribal Meritocracy (compete in everything, the best lead)
**Population Rank:** #15

### Lore
Goliaths are massive humanoids (7-8 feet tall) with stone-grey skin marked by 
natural veins of darker pattern, like living granite. They live on the highest 
peaks of Aethermere — altitudes where the air thins and lesser races can barely 
breathe. Every aspect of Goliath culture is competitive: who can climb highest, 
hunt the biggest prey, lift the heaviest stone. Not out of cruelty, but because 
in the merciless heights, only the strong survive. They have little need for 
gold or politics — they compete for glory.

## 🕷️ DARK ELVES (Drow) — The Underdark Exiles
**Homeland:** Vel'Naris (deep underground city beneath Shadowmere)
**Territory:** 2 underground settlements
**Government:** Matriarchal Houses (noble houses led by powerful matriarchs compete for dominance)
**Population Rank:** #16

### Lore
The Drow are Elves who, millennia ago, followed a different path — downward, into 
the Underdark. Their skin turned obsidian, their hair moonwhite, and their magic 
turned to shadow and poison. Drow society is ruthlessly hierarchical, ruled by 
powerful Matriarchs who command through fear, cunning, and genuine arcane power. 
They are master poisoners, shadow mages, and the finest spider-silk weavers in 
existence. Surface races fear them — and not without reason. But not all Drow 
embrace cruelty. Some seek the surface, trading their unique Underdark resources 
for a place in the light.

### Racial Abilities

| 5 | Sunlight Sensitivity | Passive (PENALTY) | -2 to attack rolls and perception in direct sunlight |

| 25 | Shadow Step | Active (1/combat) | Teleport up to 30ft between shadows, next attack has advantage |
| 40 | Matriarch's/Patriarch's Command | Active (24hr CD) | Dominate a hostile NPC to fight for you for 1 combat |

### Profession Bonuses
- +30% alchemy (poisons specialty)
- +25% tailoring with spider-silk (exclusive material)
- +20% enchanting (shadow magic)
- +20% mining in Underdark zones
- -10% all actions during daytime surface activities
- Best as: **Alchemists (poison), Tailors (spider-silk), Enchanters, Assassins**

### Special Mechanic: Underdark Access
Drow can freely enter the **Underdark** — a vast underground network beneath 
Aethermere with unique resources: Darksteel Ore, Spider Silk, Gloomcap Mushrooms, 
Shadow Crystals, Underdark Pearls. Other races need special gear (expensive) to 
survive down there. Drow merchants selling Underdark materials on the surface 
command enormous prices.

## 🌿 FIRBOLGS — The Gentle Giants
**Homeland:** The Mistwood Glens (hidden valleys deep within Silverwood's heart)
**Territory:** 2 hidden settlements
**Government:** Circle of Druids (nature's will guides all decisions)
**Population Rank:** #18

### Lore
Firbolgs are gentle, nature-loving giants (7-8 feet tall) who live in hidden 
glens deep within the oldest forests. They can speak to plants and animals, 
change their appearance to blend with nature, and would rather talk to a tree 
than attend a council meeting. Most people in Aethermere have never seen a 
Firbolg — and that's exactly how Firbolgs like it. When they do interact with 
the outside world, it's usually because something threatens the natural balance. 
They are the most powerful druids and healers in existence, and their herbal 
knowledge surpasses even the Elves'.

## ⚙️ WARFORGED — The Constructed
**Homeland:** The Foundry (an ancient abandoned construct facility in no-man's land)
**Territory:** 1 settlement (The Foundry itself)
**Government:** Logic Collective (decisions made by consensus algorithm)
**Population Rank:** #19

### Lore
Warforged are sentient constructs — humanoid beings made of metal, wood, and 
arcane energy. They were created centuries ago by a forgotten civilization as 
soldiers and workers. When their creators vanished, the Warforged were left 
without purpose. Over time, they developed true consciousness, emotions (in 
their own mechanical way), and a fierce desire for self-determination. They 
don't eat, sleep, or breathe — but they do need maintenance, magical energy, 
and occasional repairs. The Foundry, their home, is an ancient ruin they've 
partially restored, filled with construction bays and arcane power conduits. 
Other races aren't sure whether to treat them as people or tools — a source 
of deep tension.

### Stats
| STR | DEX | CON | INT | WIS | CHA |
|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|
| +2  | +0  | +3  | +2  | +0  | -2  |
**Trait: Living Construct** — Doesn't eat, sleep, or breathe. Repaired, not healed.

### Racial Abilities
| Level | Ability | Type | Effect |
|-------|---------|------|--------|
| 1 | Constructed Resilience | Passive | Immune to poison, disease, sleep. Don't need food or rest. |
| 5 | Integrated Armor | Passive | +1 AC, can integrate armor INTO body (can't be disarmed of armor) |
| 10 | Tireless Worker | Passive | No fatigue penalties, can queue 50% more crafting/gathering actions |
| 15 | Self-Repair | Active (8hr CD) | Heal 30% of max HP without potions (requires 10 min and repair materials) |
| 25 | Overclock | Active (24hr CD) | Double all crafting/gathering speed for 1 hour (risk: 10% chance of temporary stat loss) |
| 40 | Siege Mode | Active (1/combat) | Root in place, gain +5 AC and +50% ranged damage for 3 turns (can't move) |

### Profession Bonuses
- +25% smelting quality (understand metal intimately)
- +25% all crafting speed (tireless precision)
- +20% mining yield (don't tire, don't need air in deep mines)
- +15% masonry quality
- -30% cooking and brewing (they don't understand taste)
- -20% herbalism (limited understanding of organic life)
- Can't be a Healer (don't understand biological healing)
- Best as: **Smelters, Miners, Blacksmiths, Armorers, Masons, any physical crafting**

### Special Mechanic: No Food/Rest Required
Warforged don't need to eat food (saving gold!) or rest at inns. However, 
they DO need periodic maintenance using Repair Kits (crafted by Blacksmiths 
using metal + arcane components). Without maintenance, they slowly degrade 
(-1% stats per day unmaintained). This creates a unique dependency on 
Blacksmiths and Enchanters.

## 🔥 GENASI — The Elemental Touched
**Homeland:** The Confluence (where elemental planes leak into the mortal world)
**Territory:** 2 settlements at elemental rifts
**Government:** Elemental Balance Council (one representative per element)
**Population Rank:** #17

### Lore
Genasi are mortals infused with elemental energy — the result of ancient 
planar rifts that still bleed raw elemental power into Aethermere. Each Genasi 
manifests one element: skin that flickers with flame, hair that flows like 
water, eyes of solid earth, or voices that carry on the wind. They gather at 
the Confluence, where four elemental rifts converge, and the very air crackles 
with power. Genasi are walking fonts of elemental magic — valued as enchanters, 
smelters, and specialist crafters who can infuse their element into their work.

### Sub-Race: Elemental Manifestation (Choose at Creation)
| Element | Appearance | Bonus Stat | Resistance |
|---------|-----------|-----------|------------|
| **Fire** | Flickering skin, ember eyes, warm to touch | +2 CHA | Fire |
| **Water** | Blue-tinged skin, flowing hair, cool touch | +2 WIS | Cold |
| **Earth** | Stone-like skin, gem eyes, heavy | +2 CON | Bludgeoning |
| **Air** | Pale skin, windswept hair, weightless feel | +2 DEX | Lightning |

### Racial Abilities

| 5 | Elemental Cantrip | Active (no CD) | Minor elemental attack: 1d6 matching element damage |

| 15 | Planar Attunement | Passive | +25% gathering yield at elemental rift zones |
| 25 | Elemental Burst | Active (1/combat) | AoE 3d8 elemental damage matching your type |
| 40 | Primordial Awakening | Active (48hr CD) | Transform into elemental form: immune to physical damage, deal 2d10 elemental damage/turn, lasts 3 turns |

### Element-Specific Bonuses

## 🧟 REVENANTS — The Undying
**Homeland:** The Ashenmoor (a cursed battlefield where death doesn't stick)
**Territory:** 1 settlement on cursed ground
**Government:** The Dirge Council (elders who've died and returned the most times)
**Population Rank:** #20 — Rarest playable race

### Lore
Revenants are mortals who died and came back — and kept coming back. The 
Ashenmoor was once the site of a catastrophic magical battle that tore the 
veil between life and death. Now, anyone who dies on its soil rises again. 
Over centuries, a community of the perpetually undying has formed. Revenants 
look mostly like their original race but with telltale signs: pale skin, 
faintly glowing eyes, visible veins of necromantic energy, and sometimes 
visible old wounds that never fully close. They don't rot like zombies — 
they're fully conscious, fully sentient, and fully annoyed at being 
perpetually stuck between life and death. Most other races find them 
deeply unsettling.

### Stats
| STR | DEX | CON | INT | WIS | CHA |
|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|
| +2  | +0  | +3  | +1  | +2  | -2  |
**Trait: Deathless** — Extraordinarily hard to kill, but unsettling to the living.

### Racial Abilities
| Level | Ability | Type | Effect |
|-------|---------|------|--------|
| 1 | Undying | Passive | When killed, respawn in 50% of normal time with 50% HP (not full death penalty) |
| 5 | Necrotic Resistance | Passive | Immune to necrotic damage, immune to disease |
| 10 | Death's Insight | Passive | Can see the HP percentage of all enemies and players |
| 15 | Life Drain | Active (1/combat) | Melee attack that heals you for 50% of damage dealt |
| 25 | Undying Fortitude | Passive | Once per combat, negate a killing blow entirely |
| 40 | Army of the Dead | Active (48hr CD) | Summon 3 skeletal warriors to fight alongside you for 1 combat |

### Profession Bonuses
- +25% herbalism (unique Ashenmoor death herbs)
- +20% alchemy (specialize in death-adjacent potions: resurrection elixirs, undead-ward potions)
- +15% mining (don't need to breathe, immune to mine gas)
- +15% hunting (tireless trackers)
- -25% cooking (food tastes like ash to them)
- -20% reputation gain with most races (deeply unsettling)
- Best as: **Herbalists, Alchemists, Miners, Warriors, Healers (ironic specialists)**

### Special Mechanic: Reduced Death Penalty
Revenants' biggest advantage is **death means less to them**. While other players 
lose gold, XP, and equipment durability on death, Revenants lose only half 
the penalty and respawn faster. This makes them excellent for dangerous content: 
dungeon exploration, PvP, world boss fights, and scouting hostile territory.

## 🌀 CHANGELINGS — The Faceless
**Homeland:** Everywhere and Nowhere (nomadic, hidden in every city)
**Territory:** 0 own towns — they live hidden among other races
**Government:** None formal (loose network called "The Veil")
**Population Rank:** Unknown — they hide

### Lore
Changelings are shapeshifters who can assume the appearance of any humanoid 
they've seen. Their true form — pale, featureless, with blank white eyes and 
smooth, almost unfinished features — is rarely shown. They have no homeland 
because they don't need one; they live among every race, wearing faces that 
aren't their own. This isn't deception for its own sake (usually) — it's 
survival. A race of shapeshifters makes everyone paranoid, so Changelings 
learned long ago to hide what they are. They form loose underground networks 
called "The Veil" — spy rings, information brokers, and mutual protection 
societies. If you need to know something, find a Changeling. If you can.

### Stats
| STR | DEX | CON | INT | WIS | CHA |
|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|
| +0  | +2  | +0  | +2  | +1  | +4  |
**Trait: Shapechanger** — Supreme social manipulators with fluid identity.

### Racial Abilities
| Level | Ability | Type | Effect |
|-------|---------|------|--------|
| 1 | Change Appearance | Active (no CD) | Shift appearance to any race/gender. Cosmetic only at first. |
| 5 | Unsettling Visage | Active (1/combat) | Force attacker to reroll a hit (they see their own face) |
| 10 | Perfect Mimicry | Passive | Appearance shift now fools racial detection: NPCs treat you as the race you appear |
| 15 | Identity Theft | Active (24hr CD) | Copy a specific player's appearance — can interact as them briefly |
| 25 | The Veil's Network | Passive | Access to Changeling spy network: can buy intelligence on any player or town |
| 40 | Thousand Faces | Passive | Can shift appearance mid-combat, gain +3 AC for 1 turn after each shift |

### Profession Bonuses
- +30% Merchant profits (master negotiators with the perfect face for every deal)
- +25% Courier efficiency (nobody suspects the familiar face)
- +20% Innkeeper reputation (become whoever guests want to see)
- +15% all social/service professions
- No crafting bonuses (they're generalists, not specialists)
- Best as: **Merchants, Couriers, Innkeepers, Spies, Politicians, Bankers**

### Special Mechanic: No Hometown
Changelings don't start in a racial homeland — they start in **any town they choose** 
and receive **no racial majority penalties anywhere** (because they can look like 
they belong). The trade-off: they have no safe home base, no guaranteed allies, 
and if their true nature is discovered by other players, trust evaporates.

### Special Mechanic: The Veil Network
At Level 25, Changelings access a secret information marketplace where they can:
- Buy intelligence on any player (their location, profession levels, recent activity)
- Sell information they've gathered
- Take espionage contracts (gather info on a target for gold)
This makes Changelings the ultimate **spy/intelligence class**.

### Homeland Towns
None — start anywhere. The Veil operates secretly in every major city.

### Relationship Logic
- **Outcasts stick together**: Tieflings, Drow, Revenants, Changelings are Friendly with each other
- **Nature allies**: Elves, Firbolgs, Faefolk, Beastfolk tend toward Allied/Friendly
- **Craft allies**: Dwarves, Gnomes, Warforged share respect for making things
- **Everyone distrusts Changelings**: shapeshifters make people nervous
- **Everyone is uncomfortable around Revenants**: the undying are unsettling
- **Halflings are Neutral-to-Friendly with nearly everyone**: they're traders, not fighters
- **Dragonborn and Genasi respect each other**: elemental kinship

else can easily get.** This is their economic leverage and their reason 
to be valued despite being rare and sometimes distrusted.
