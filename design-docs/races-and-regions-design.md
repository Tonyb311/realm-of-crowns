# Realm of Crowns — Races, Regions & Territories
## "The World and Its Peoples"

---

## 🎯 Core Philosophy

Every race has a **homeland** — a region they historically control. But this is a 
player-driven world, so borders shift. A Dwarf can live in Elf lands. An Orc can 
become mayor of a Human town. But racial tensions, bonuses, and regional advantages 
mean that where you live and what you are MATTERS. Your race isn't just cosmetic — 
it shapes your stats, your abilities, your crafting bonuses, how NPCs treat you, 
and the political landscape around you.

---

## 🌍 WORLD MAP OVERVIEW

The world is called **Aethermere** — a continent divided into 8 major regions, 
each historically tied to a race. Think of it as a large interconnected landmass 
with diverse biomes.

## 🧬 THE RACES OF AETHERMERE

---

### 🏰 HUMANS — The Builders
**Homeland:** The Verdant Heartlands
**Government Style:** Feudal Monarchy (elected King, appointed nobles)
**Population:** Largest race — they're everywhere

#### Lore
Humans are the most numerous and adaptable race in Aethermere. They lack the 
longevity of Elves, the resilience of Dwarves, or the raw power of Orcs, but 
they compensate with ambition, versatility, and sheer numbers. The Heartlands 
are the political and economic center of the continent — a breadbasket of 
fertile plains, rolling hills, and thriving cities. Humans are builders of 
empires, and their kingdoms have risen and fallen more times than any scholar 
can count.

#### Racial Stats
| Stat | Modifier |
|------|----------|
| STR | +1 |
| DEX | +1 |
| CON | +1 |
| INT | +1 |

---

### 🌿 ELVES — The Eternal
**Homeland:** The Silverwood Forest
**Government Style:** Elder Council (ancient, wise elders rule by consensus)
**Population:** Low — they live long but reproduce slowly

#### Lore
The Elves of Silverwood have inhabited their ancient forest since before human 
memory. They are deeply connected to nature, magic, and the arcane currents that 
flow through the land. The Silverwood itself is alive — trees that are thousands 
of years old, rivers that sing, glades where the veil between worlds grows thin. 
Elves are master archers, enchanters, and herbalists. They view other races with 
a mix of curiosity and gentle condescension — after all, what can a creature that 
lives 80 years truly understand? Their greatest fear is the slow corruption of 
the wild places by industry and war.

#### Racial Stats
| Stat | Modifier |
|------|----------|
| STR | +0 |
| DEX | +3 |
| CON | -1 |
| INT | +2 |

### ⛏️ DWARVES — The Forgemasters
**Homeland:** The Ironvault Mountains
**Government Style:** Thane Council (clan leaders elected by merit and deed)
**Population:** Medium — clannish, concentrated in mountain holds

#### Lore
Dwarves have carved their civilization into the bones of the Ironvault Mountains 
over uncounted centuries. Their cities are vast underground complexes of halls, 
forges, mines, and vaults — illuminated by magma channels and phosphorescent 
crystals. Dwarven craftsmanship is the gold standard of Aethermere; a Dwarven-made 
blade is worth three Human-made ones. They are stubborn, loyal, and direct — they 
say what they mean and they mean what they say. Their society revolves around clan 
honor, craft mastery, and the eternal work of delving deeper into the mountain. 
Their greatest foes are the Orcs of the Ashenfang Wastes, with whom they share a 
bitter border and centuries of blood feuds.

#### Racial Stats
| Stat | Modifier |
|------|----------|
| STR | +2 |
| DEX | -1 |
| CON | +3 |
| INT | +1 |
| WIS | +1 |
| CHA | +0 |
**Trait: Stoneborn** — Incredibly tough and strong, but slow and not the most charming.

| **Dwarven Resilience** | 5 | Resistance to poison damage, +3 to poison saving throws |

### 🏕️ HALFLINGS — The Wanderers
**Homeland:** The Crossroads
**Government Style:** Town Councils (direct democracy, every voice counts)
**Population:** Medium — spread everywhere, concentrated in Crossroads

#### Lore
Halflings occupy the most strategically valuable land in Aethermere — the 
Crossroads, where every major trade route intersects. And that's no accident. 
Halflings have an uncanny knack for being in the right place at the right time, 
for making deals that benefit everyone (especially themselves), and for turning 
enemies into friends over a good meal. They are small in stature but enormous in 
influence — the wealthiest merchants, the shrewdest bankers, the best cooks, and 
the sneakiest rogues in the land all tend to be Halflings. They don't build empires; 
they build networks. Never underestimate a Halfling.

#### Racial Stats
| Stat | Modifier |
|------|----------|
| STR | -1 |
| DEX | +3 |
| CON | +1 |
| INT | +1 |
| WIS | +1 |
| CHA | +2 |

---

### ⚔️ ORCS — The Warborn
**Homeland:** The Ashenfang Wastes
**Government Style:** Warchief (strongest leads — can be challenged to combat)
**Population:** Medium-Large — aggressive expansion, frequent border conflicts

#### Lore
The Orcs of Ashenfang are forged by hardship. Their homeland is a brutal expanse 
of scorched badlands, volcanic rock, and sparse resources — a land that kills the 
weak and hardens the strong. Orc society is built on strength, honor in combat, 
and the clan. The Warchief rules not by birthright but by being the most powerful — 
anyone can challenge for leadership through ritual combat. This breeds a culture 
of constant self-improvement and fierce competition. Orcs are often misunderstood 
by other races as mindless brutes, but their warriors are tactically brilliant, 
their shamans command powerful primal magic, and their survival skills are 
unmatched. They trade in leather, bone, war beasts, and mercenary services. 
Their eternal enemies are the Dwarves across the mountain border.

#### Racial Stats
| Stat | Modifier |
|------|----------|
| STR | +4 |
| DEX | +0 |
| CON | +3 |
| INT | -1 |
| WIS | +0 |

### 😈 TIEFLINGS — The Outcast
**Homeland:** Shadowmere Marshes
**Government Style:** Shadow Council (secretive, ruled by information and influence)
**Population:** Small — distrusted by most, tight-knit communities

#### Lore
Tieflings bear the mark of infernal heritage — horns, tails, unusual eyes, and 
an innate connection to dark magic. Whether this heritage is a curse, a pact made 
by ancient ancestors, or simply a different branch of mortal evolution is debated. 
What isn't debated is the prejudice they face. Driven from most civilized lands 
generations ago, Tieflings found refuge in the Shadowmere Marshes — a treacherous 
land of bogs, mists, and things that lurk beneath still waters. They've thrived 
there, mastering alchemy, dark magic, and the art of surviving where others won't 
go. Their society runs on information — secrets are currency, and the Shadow 
Council knows everyone's. They make powerful allies and terrifying enemies.

#### Racial Stats
| Stat | Modifier |
|------|----------|
| STR | +0 |
| DEX | +1 |
| CON | +0 |
| INT | +3 |

### 🐉 DRAGONBORN — The Ancient Blood
**Homeland:** The Frozen Reaches
**Government Style:** Clan Elders + Dragon Oracle (spiritual/warrior hybrid)
**Population:** Smallest — rare, respected, feared

#### Lore
The Dragonborn claim descent from the great dragons themselves — a claim 
supported by their scaled skin, breath weapons, and imposing stature. They 
inhabit the Frozen Reaches, a land of glacial tundra, volcanic peaks, and 
ancient dragon lairs. Their society is divided into clans, each associated 
with a dragon color and element. They are warriors, shamans, and keepers of 
the oldest magic in Aethermere. Other races regard them with a mix of awe 
and unease. Dragonborn are rare — seeing one in a Human city draws stares. 
They tend to be honorable, proud, and slow to make friends but fiercely loyal 
to those who earn their trust. Their craftsmanship leans toward the primal — 
bone, scale, and elemental magic.

#### Draconic Ancestry (Sub-Race Choice at Character Creation)
| Ancestry | Element | Breath Weapon Shape | Resistance |
|----------|---------|-------------------|------------|
| **Red** | Fire | 15ft Cone | Fire |
| **Blue** | Lightning | 30ft Line | Lightning |

## 🌊 THE SUNCOAST — Contested Free Cities

**Not controlled by any single race.** This is the neutral zone.

#### Lore
The Suncoast is a stretch of warm coastline that no single race has ever managed 
to hold permanently. Instead, it has become a collection of independent Free Cities — 
cosmopolitan, chaotic, and endlessly interesting. Here, a Dwarf and an Orc can 
drink in the same tavern. A Tiefling can run for mayor without being lynched. 
The Free Cities are governed by whoever has the gold, the votes, or the swords 
to hold power. They are the economic engine of Aethermere — every major trade 
route terminates here, the largest marketplace in the world operates here, and 
the most diverse population in the world lives here.

#### Why It Matters for Gameplay
- **Neutral ground** — all races welcome equally, no racial tension penalties
- **Highest trade volume** — the Grand Bazaar has the most active marketplace
- **Melting pot** — players of all races interact here
- **Political chaos** — elections here are wild, corrupt, and entertaining
- **Starting zone option** — new players who don't want racial politics can start here

| Town | Type | Specialty | Notable Feature |
|------|------|-----------|-----------------|
| **Porto Sole** | Capital Free City | Trade, Everything | The Grand Bazaar, Adventurer's Guild HQ |
| **Coral Bay** | Coastal Town | Fishing, Shipbuilding | Best fishing, future naval content |
| **Sandrift** | Desert Edge | Gems, Glass, Exotic Goods | Desert expeditions, sand glass |
| **Libertad** | Port City | Trade, Entertainment | Arena, casinos, black market |
| **Beacon's End** | Lighthouse Town | Navigation, Cartography | Scribe headquarters, world maps |

## ⚔️ RACIAL RELATIONS & DIPLOMACY

### Default Relations (Starting State of the World)
| Race | Humans | Elves | Dwarves | Halflings | Orcs | Tieflings | Dragonborn |
|------|--------|-------|---------|-----------|------|-----------|------------|
| **Humans** | — | Friendly | Friendly | Allied | Hostile | Distrustful | Neutral |
| **Elves** | Friendly | — | Neutral | Friendly | Hostile | Distrustful | Neutral |
| **Dwarves** | Friendly | Neutral | — | Friendly | **Blood Feud** | Distrustful | Neutral |
| **Halflings** | Allied | Friendly | Friendly | — | Neutral | Neutral | Neutral |
| **Orcs** | Hostile | Hostile | **Blood Feud** | Neutral | — | Neutral | Wary |
| **Tieflings** | Distrustful | Distrustful | Distrustful | Neutral | Neutral | — | Neutral |
| **Dragonborn** | Neutral | Neutral | Neutral | Neutral | Wary | Neutral | — |

### What Relations Mean for Gameplay
| Relation | Effect |
|----------|--------|
| **Allied** | Free trade, no tariffs, can enter each other's towns freely, shared military |
| **Friendly** | Reduced tariffs, welcome in towns, small trade bonus |
| **Neutral** | Normal tariffs, no bonuses or penalties |
| **Distrustful** | Higher tariffs, NPC merchants charge you 10% more, some quests unavailable |
| **Hostile** | 25% tariff, guards watch you, risk of being attacked near borders |
| **Blood Feud** | 50% tariff, may be refused entry to towns, border PvP zones active, war quests available |

### PLAYERS CAN CHANGE THIS
- A Halfling mayor who makes friends with Orcs can change their town's stance
- Kingdom rulers can sign treaties, declare wars, form alliances
- Enough player-driven diplomacy can shift an entire racial relationship
- But deep-rooted tensions (Dwarf-Orc Blood Feud) are VERY hard to change — 
  requires massive coordinated player effort over real-time weeks

---

## 🏠 LIVING IN FOREIGN LANDS

A player of any race can live in any town, but there are consequences:

### Racial Majority Bonuses
- If you live in a town where your race is the majority: **+10% all profession bonuses**
- If you live in a town where your race is welcome (Friendly+): **Normal, no bonus**
- If you live in a town where your race is distrusted: **-5% profession yields, NPCs charge more**
- If you live in a town during a Blood Feud: **-15% everything, risk of PvP attacks, can't run for office**

### Racial Minority Opportunities
Being a minority isn't ALL bad:
- A **Dwarf Blacksmith in a Human town** brings skills they don't have locally — 
  they can charge premium prices because the competition is weaker
- An **Elf Enchanter in Orc lands** is rare and valuable — Orcs need enchanted weapons 
  but can't make them well themselves
- A **Tiefling Alchemist anywhere** is in high demand because Tiefling potions are the best

This creates interesting choices: stay home for bonuses, or move where your 
skills are rare and command higher prices?

| **Crossroads** (Halfling) | Grain, Herbs, Vegetables | Fish (rivers), Softwood | Ore, Exotic Materials |
| **Ashenfang Wastes** (Orc) | Leather, Bone, Obsidian, War Beasts | Limited Iron, Stone | Wood, Grain, Herbs, Fish |
| **Shadowmere Marshes** (Tiefling) | Rare Herbs, Reagents, Mushrooms, Exotic Leather | Fish, Some Wood | Ore, Grain, Livestock |
| **Frozen Reaches** (Dragonborn) | Mithril, Adamantine (volcanic), Exotic Furs, Bone | Fish (coastal), Stone | Wood, Grain, Most Herbs |
| **Suncoast** (Free Cities) | Fish, Salt, Sand/Glass, Gems (limited) | Trade goods (everything passes through) | Ore, Wood, Livestock |

This table IS the economy. A Dwarven kingdom swimming in ore NEEDS Halfling grain 
and Elven wood. An Orc warband with mountains of leather NEEDS Dwarven steel for 
weapons. Every race needs what another race has. **Trade is survival.**

## 🔮 FUTURE EXPANSION: RACIAL QUESTLINES

Each race should have a unique Main Story questline:
- **Humans:** Unite the fractured noble houses, become King, deal with internal rebellion
- **Elves:** Heal the corruption spreading through the Silverwood, confront ancient evil
- **Dwarves:** Reclaim the Deep Halls lost to monsters, find the legendary forge
- **Halflings:** Build the greatest trade empire, uncover a conspiracy in the banking guild
- **Orcs:** Challenge the Warchief, unite the clans, prove Orcs are more than savages
- **Tieflings:** Discover the true origin of Tiefling heritage, break the curse (or embrace it)
- **Dragonborn:** Awaken the last sleeping dragon, choose whether to serve or rule

## 📐 BALANCE NOTES

### Why This Is Balanced
1. **No "best" race** — each excels in different systems
   - Want to fight? Orc or Dragonborn
   - Want to craft the best gear? Dwarf
   - Want to do everything decently? Human
   - Want to make money? Halfling
   - Want to dominate magic? Elf or Tiefling
   - Want to be rare and powerful? Dragonborn

2. **Geographic dependency** forces cooperation between races

3. **Racial tensions create content** — diplomacy, wars, trade negotiations, 
   espionage, racial politics in elections

4. **Living abroad is a valid strategy** — minority races in foreign lands 
   can fill unique niches and charge premiums

5. **Players can change the world** — racial relations aren't fixed, 
   they're shaped by player actions over time
