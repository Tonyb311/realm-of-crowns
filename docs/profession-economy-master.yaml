# =============================================================================
# SECTION 4: COOK RECIPE TREE (FIRST CRAFTING PROFESSION)
# =============================================================================
# COOK is the first crafting profession to be fully implemented.
# It establishes the pattern for all other crafting professions.
#
# Design principles:
# - Every recipe uses resources that exist (or will exist) as gathered items
# - Progressive complexity: T1 = 1 input, T2 = 2 inputs, T3 = 2-3 inputs
# - Intermediate ingredients (Flour) are crafted by COOK and reused in higher tiers
# - Crafted food > raw food in both HP restore and sell value
# - Food grants buffs at higher tiers (economic incentive to level COOK)

# SECTION 6: ECONOMY RULES
# =============================================================================

economy_rules:

  value_chain:
    principle: "Each profession step adds value"
    example: "Apple (3g) → Apple Sauce (8g) → Apple Pie (18g) → Harvest Feast (35g)"
    rule: "Crafted output base_value > sum of input base_values"

  scarcity_by_region:
    principle: "Different towns produce different resources"
    rule: "No town has all resource types. Players must travel or trade."
    example: "Ironvault has mines but no orchards. Must buy food from Heartlands."
    wood_scarcity: "COOKs in non-forest towns (no forest gathering spot) must buy Wood Logs from LUMBERJACKs or the marketplace. Creates cross-profession trade pressure."

  profession_limit:
    max_per_character: 3
    principle: "No self-sufficiency"
    example: "FARMER + COOK + MERCHANT = gather crops, cook food, sell it well"
    counter: "But they can't mine, smelt, or smith — need other players for weapons"

  durability_and_consumption:
    principle: "Items break or are consumed, creating perpetual demand"
    food: "Consumed on use — gone forever"
    equipment: "Has durability — breaks after use, needs repair or replacement"
    potions: "Single use"
    buildings: "Require upkeep materials"

  quality_system:
    formula: "d20 + (ProfessionLevel / 5) + ToolBonus + WorkshopBonus + TierQualityBonus"
    tiers: [Poor, Common, Fine, Superior, Masterwork, Legendary]
    effect: "Higher quality = better stats/effects + higher sell value"

    note: "Applies to crafting. Gathering yield uses tier_yield_bonus instead."

    EXPERT: "+75%"
    MASTER: "+100%"

    formula: "finalQuantity = ceil(baseQuantity * (1 + tierBonus))"
    note: "Only applies to unlocked spot types. Replaces old flat +50% bonus."
