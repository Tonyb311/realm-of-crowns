# Part 1: Welcome to Aethermere

## What is Realm of Crowns?

Realm of Crowns is a persistent multiplayer RPG set in the continent of Aethermere -- a land of warring kingdoms, ancient magic, and boundless opportunity. You will create a character, choose a race and class, explore a world of 68 towns across 21 territories, fight monsters and other players, craft legendary equipment, climb the political ladder, and build your legacy.

This is not a game where you simply grind levels and move on. Aethermere is a living world. Mayors are elected by players. Laws are passed by vote. Wars between kingdoms are declared by rulers and fought by citizens. Prices on the marketplace shift with supply and demand. The sword your Dwarven blacksmith forges today might end up in the hands of an Orc warrior tomorrow, bought through a Halfling merchant's stall.

## Your First Steps

When you first enter Aethermere, you will:

1. **Choose a Race** -- One of 20 playable races across three tiers (Core, Common, Exotic). Your race determines your starting stats, homeland, racial abilities, and profession bonuses. Choose carefully; this cannot be changed.

2. **Choose a Class** -- One of 7 classes (Warrior, Mage, Rogue, Cleric, Ranger, Bard, Psion). At level 10, you will pick a specialization within your class, unlocking a unique skill tree of 6 abilities.

3. **Arrive in Your Homeland** -- You begin in one of your race's starting towns. From here, the world opens up. Talk to the town elder. Pick up your first quest. Swing a sword at a rat. The journey begins.

## Key Concepts

**Levels and XP** -- You gain experience points (XP) from combat, crafting, and quests. XP accumulates and triggers level-ups, which grant stat points, skill points, and increased HP/Mana.

**Stats** -- Six attributes define your character: Strength (STR), Dexterity (DEX), Constitution (CON), Intelligence (INT), Wisdom (WIS), and Charisma (CHA). Your race provides base modifiers; you earn 2 stat points per level to spend as you wish.

**Classes and Specializations** -- Your class determines your combat role. At level 10, you choose a specialization that unlocks a tree of 6 abilities, growing in power from tier 1 (level 10) to tier 5 (level 40).

**Professions** -- The backbone of Aethermere's economy. You can learn up to 3 professions (gathering, crafting, or service). Professions level from 1 to 100 across 6 tiers, from Apprentice to Grandmaster.

**Politics** -- Towns have elected mayors. Regions have rulers elected by mayors. Leaders set tax rates, propose laws, appoint officials, manage treasuries, declare wars, and negotiate peace.

**The Marketplace** -- A player-driven economy where supply, demand, and quality determine prices. A Masterwork Dwarven blade sells for far more than a Poor-quality one.

---

# Part 2: Character Creation

## The Six Stats

Every character has six core attributes. Your race provides a starting modifier, and you gain **2 unspent stat points per level** to distribute as you choose.

| Stat | Abbr | What It Does |
|------|------|-------------|
| Strength | STR | Melee damage, carrying capacity, physical feats |
| Dexterity | DEX | Ranged attacks, dodge chance, stealth, initiative |
| Constitution | CON | Hit points, stamina, poison/disease resistance |
| Intelligence | INT | Spell damage, crafting quality, mana pool |
| Wisdom | WIS | Healing power, perception, saving throws |
| Charisma | CHA | Trading prices, social abilities, leadership |

> **Tip:** Don't spread your points too thin. A Warrior who dumps everything into STR and CON will outperform one who tries to be good at everything.

---

## Races

Aethermere is home to 20 playable races, divided into three tiers based on complexity and accessibility.

### Race Tiers

- **Core Races (7)** -- Recommended for new players. Straightforward bonuses, well-documented lore, and strong starting positions. These are: Human, Elf, Dwarf, Halfling, Orc, Tiefling, and Dragonborn.

- **Common Races (6)** -- Hybrid or specialized races with unique mechanics. Good for players who want something different. These are: Half-Elf, Half-Orc, Gnome, Merfolk, Beastfolk, and Faefolk.

- **Exotic Races (7)** -- Advanced races with powerful abilities balanced by significant trade-offs. Not recommended for your first character. These are: Goliath, Drow, Firbolg, Warforged, Genasi, Revenant, and Changeling.

---

### Core Races

#### Humans

> *"Humans build empires, and their kingdoms have risen and fallen more times than any scholar can count."*

| Stat | STR | DEX | CON | INT | WIS | CHA |
|------|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|
| Modifier | +1 | +1 | +1 | +1 | +1 | +1 |

**Trait: Adaptive** -- +1 to ALL stats. Jack of all trades.

**Homeland:** The Verdant Heartlands
**Starting Towns:** Kingshold, Millhaven, Bridgewater, Ironford, Whitefield

**Racial Abilities:**
| Level | Ability | Effect |
|-------|---------|--------|
| 1 | Versatile Learner | +10% XP gain for ALL professions |
| 5 | Diplomatic Tongue | +15% reputation gain with all races |
| 10 | Rally the People | Party buff: +2 all stats for 1 hour (24h cooldown) |
| 15 | Adaptable Crafter | Can learn a 4th profession (normally max 3) |
| 25 | Empire Builder | Buildings cost 10% fewer materials |
| 40 | Indomitable Will | Once per combat, reroll a failed saving throw |

**Profession Bonuses:** +10% farming yield, +5% all crafting speed, +15% trading yield

**Playstyle:** The most versatile race in the game. Humans lack the raw power of Orcs or the crafting mastery of Dwarves, but they do everything well. The Adaptable Crafter ability at level 15 is unique -- no other race can learn 4 professions. Humans are the best generalists and strong political leaders thanks to Diplomatic Tongue.

---

#### Elves

> *"What can a creature that lives 80 years truly understand?"*

| Stat | STR | DEX | CON | INT | WIS | CHA |
|------|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|
| Modifier | +0 | +3 | -1 | +2 | +2 | +1 |

**Trait: Graceful** -- High dexterity and mental stats, physically frail.

**Homeland:** The Silverwood Forest
**Starting Towns:** Aelindra, Moonhaven, Thornwatch, Willowmere, Eldergrove

**Racial Abilities:**
| Level | Ability | Effect |
|-------|---------|--------|
| 1 | Keen Senses | +20% chance to find rare resources while gathering |
| 5 | Elven Accuracy | Advantage (roll 2d20, take higher) on ranged attacks |
| 10 | Communion with Nature | Gathering in forests takes 25% less time |
| 15 | Arcane Affinity | +2 bonus to Enchanting quality rolls |
| 25 | Ageless Knowledge | +15% XP for Enchanter, Herbalist, Scribe |
| 40 | Spirit Walk | Invisibility for 30 seconds (24h cooldown) |

**Profession Bonuses:** +25% herbalism yield, +20% enchanting quality, +15% woodworking quality, +10% alchemy quality

**Playstyle:** Elves are the premier magic-oriented gatherer/crafters. Their DEX makes them excellent Rangers and Rogues. The combination of Keen Senses and Communion with Nature makes Elven herbalists the fastest and most productive gatherers in the game. Elven Accuracy is devastating for Sharpshooter Rangers.

---

#### Dwarves

> *"A Dwarven blade is worth three Human-made ones."*

| Stat | STR | DEX | CON | INT | WIS | CHA |
|------|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|

| 40 | Ancestral Fury | Below 25% HP: +5 STR and +5 CON |

**Profession Bonuses:** +30% mining yield, +25% blacksmithing quality, +25% armoring quality, +20% smelting speed, +15% masonry quality

**Playstyle:** The undisputed kings of mining and metalwork. Dwarves have the highest crafting quality bonuses in the game for blacksmithing and armoring. Their exclusive Deep Mines zone gives access to rare ores no other race can reach. Pair with the Guardian Warrior specialization for an unkillable tank, or focus purely on crafting to become the wealthiest smith on the server. Ancestral Fury at level 40 makes them terrifying in PvP when low on health.

---

#### Halflings

> *"Small in stature, enormous in influence."*

| Stat | STR | DEX | CON | INT | WIS | CHA |
|------|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|
| Modifier | -1 | +3 | +1 | +1 | +1 | +2 |

**Trait: Lucky** -- Quick, charming, impossibly fortunate.

| 40 | Feast Master | Food you cook gives double buff duration |

**Profession Bonuses:** +25% cooking quality, +20% brewing quality, +20% trading yield, +15% farming yield, +10% all gathering speed

**Playstyle:** The merchant race. Halflings are built to make money. Silver Tongue gives a 10% spread advantage on every marketplace transaction, and Trade Network at level 25 lets you see prices across all 68 towns -- enabling arbitrage that no other race can match. Their cooking and brewing bonuses make them the best food producers. Excellent Rogues thanks to high DEX and CHA.

---

#### Orcs

> *"Their warriors are tactically brilliant and their shamans command powerful primal magic."*

| Stat | STR | DEX | CON | INT | WIS | CHA |
|------|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|
| Modifier | +4 | +0 | +3 | -1 | +0 | -1 |

**Trait: Savage Might** -- Raw physical power, unmatched in melee.

**Homeland:** The Ashenfang Wastes
**Starting Towns:** Grakthar, Bonepile, Ironfist Hold, Thornback Camp, Ashen Market

**Racial Abilities:**
| Level | Ability | Effect |
|-------|---------|--------|
| 1 | Intimidating Presence | Enemies -1 to first attack roll against you |

**Profession Bonuses:** +30% hunting yield, +20% tanning quality, +20% leatherworking quality, +15% ranching speed, +10% combat loot yield

**Playstyle:** Born for combat. Orcs have the highest STR modifier in the core races (+4) and a suite of abilities that reward aggressive play. Blood Fury + Relentless Endurance creates a deadly feedback loop: you get stronger as you take damage, and you refuse to die. Orcish Rampage at 40 turns you into a chain-killing machine. On the crafting side, Orcs dominate leather goods. Pair with Berserker Warrior for maximum destruction.

---

#### Tieflings

> *"Their society runs on information -- secrets are currency."*

| Stat | STR | DEX | CON | INT | WIS | CHA |
|------|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|
| Modifier | +0 | +1 | +0 | +3 | +1 | +2 |

**Trait: Infernal Legacy** -- Magically gifted with a dark edge.

**Homeland:** Shadowmere Marshes

| 40 | Soul Bargain | Sacrifice 25% HP for double next spell damage (24h cooldown) |

**Profession Bonuses:** +30% alchemy quality, +20% enchanting quality, +25% herbalism yield, +15% scribing quality

**Playstyle:** The premier alchemy and enchanting race. Tieflings have the highest alchemy quality bonus in the game (+30%). Their INT bonus makes them natural Mages, and Soul Bargain at level 40 can one-shot opponents in PvP with a well-timed spell. Infernal Sight is invaluable against Rogue players. Whispers of the Damned is unique -- scouting an opponent's gear before a duel gives a huge tactical advantage.

---

#### Dragonborn

> *"Rare, respected, and feared."*

| Stat | STR | DEX | CON | INT | WIS | CHA |
|------|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|
| Modifier | +3 | -1 | +2 | +1 | +2 | +0 |

| 5 | Draconic Scales | +2 natural AC |
| 10 | Elemental Resistance | Half damage from ancestry element |
| 15 | Frightful Presence | WIS save or enemies frightened, 1/combat |
| 25 | Dragon's Hoard | +20% gold from all sources |
| 40 | Ancient Wrath | Breath upgrades to 4d8, usable twice per combat |

**Profession Bonuses:** +20% mining yield, +20% smelting quality, +15% hunting yield, +15% enchanting quality, +25% combat loot yield

**Playstyle:** A hybrid combat/economy race. Dragonborn start with a built-in AoE attack (Breath Weapon) that no other race gets at level 1. The 7 draconic ancestries let you tailor your element -- Red for raw damage, Gold for radiant (anti-undead), Silver or White for cold. Dragon's Hoard at 25 makes them surprisingly wealthy. Ancient Wrath at 40 turns the Breath Weapon into a devastating 4d8 blast usable twice per combat. Excellent Warriors and Clerics.

---

### Common Races

> *"Natural diplomats, translators between cultures, and bridges across racial divides."*

| 40 | Paragon of Two Worlds | Gain BOTH the Elf and Human ability from Versatile Heritage |

**Profession Bonuses:** +20% quality on one chosen profession, +15% reputation yield, +10% trading yield

**Playstyle:** The premier social and political race. Half-Elves have the highest CHA among common races (+3) and Versatile Heritage is one of the most flexible abilities in the game -- picking Elven Accuracy gives a combat edge, while Adaptable Crafter (Human) gives a 4th profession slot. At level 40, Paragon of Two Worlds lets you have both. Cultural Ambassador reduces racial penalties by 50%, making Half-Elves welcome everywhere. Best Bards, social Clerics, and political leaders.

---

#### Half-Orcs

> *"Too gentle for Orc warbands, too savage for Human courts."*

**Playstyle:** The balanced combat/crafting hybrid. Half-Orcs get near-Orc physical stats (+3 STR, +2 CON) without the INT/CHA penalties. Savage Attacks makes crits devastating, and Proven Warrior at 25 gives one of the best XP bonuses in the game. Dual Culture at 15 means no penalties in two major regions. Excellent Warriors and Rangers who can also hold their own as blacksmiths and tanners.

---

#### Gnomes

> *"Endlessly curious people live in elaborate burrow-cities filled with clockwork mechanisms and at least one thing that's currently on fire."*

| Stat | STR | DEX | CON | INT | WIS | CHA |
|------|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|
| Modifier | -2 | +2 | +1 | +4 | +1 | +1 |

**Trait: Inventive Mind** -- Brilliant intellect, tiny stature.

**Homeland:** The Cogsworth Warrens
**Starting Towns:** Cogsworth, Sparkhollow, Fumblewick

**Racial Abilities:**
| Level | Ability | Effect |
|-------|---------|--------|

**Profession Bonuses:** +30% engineering quality, +20% alchemy quality, +15% jeweling quality, +15% scribing quality, +10% all crafting speed

**Playstyle:** The crafting geniuses. Gnomes have the highest INT in the game (+4) and the most crafting-focused ability kit. Tinker's Insight (15% quality upgrade) + Efficient Engineering (10% fewer materials) + Eureka Moment (instant craft) means Gnomes produce the most items of the highest quality for the lowest cost. Grand Innovation at 40 adds random bonus properties that make Gnome-crafted items uniquely desirable. Best Mages (especially Enchanters) and the best crafters in the game.

---

#### Merfolk

> *"They bring unique oceanic resources that no surface race can gather."*

| Stat | STR | DEX | CON | INT | WIS | CHA |
|------|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|
| Modifier | +1 | +2 | +2 | +0 | +2 | +1 |

**Trait: Amphibious** -- Can breathe water and air. Excels in water, slower on land.

**Homeland:** The Pelagic Depths
**Starting Towns:** Coralspire, Shallows End, Abyssal Reach

| Level | Ability | Effect |
|-------|---------|--------|

- Abyssal Pearls (premium jewelcrafting)
- Living Coral (unique construction material)
- Sea Silk (luxury tailoring fabric)
- Leviathan Bone (exotic weapon/armor component)
- Tideweave Kelp (rare alchemical reagent)

**Profession Bonuses:** +40% fishing yield, +30% pearl diving yield, +20% alchemy quality, +15% enchanting quality
**Profession Penalty:** -15% land gathering speed

**Playstyle:** The niche market master. Merfolk have access to 6 exclusive underwater resources that no other race can obtain. These materials craft into some of the most valuable items in the game. The trade-off is -15% land gathering speed, but smart Merfolk players never gather on land -- they farm the ocean and trade their rare goods for everything else they need. Best for players who want to corner a unique economic niche.

---

#### Beastfolk

> *"The ultimate survivalists -- hunters, trackers, and rangers without equal."*

| Stat | STR | DEX | CON | INT | WIS | CHA |
|------|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|
| Modifier | +2 | +2 | +2 | -1 | +2 | -1 |

**Trait: Primal Instinct** -- Physically gifted with supernatural senses, but distrustful of arcane.

**Homeland:** The Thornwilds
**Starting Towns:** Thornden, Clawridge, Windrun
**Exclusive Zone:** Deep Thornwilds

**Sub-Races (Clans):**

| Clan | Bonus Stat | Special Perk |

| Bear Clan | CON +1 | Thick Hide: +1 natural AC |
| Fox Clan | CHA +1 | Cunning: +15% stealth and pickpocket |
| Hawk Clan | WIS +1 | Eagle Eye: +20% ranged attack range |
| Panther Clan | DEX +1 | Shadow Pounce: first stealth attack deals 2x damage |
| Boar Clan | STR +1 | Charge: first melee attack each combat deals +1d6 |

**Racial Abilities:**
| Level | Ability | Effect |
|-------|---------|--------|
| 1 | Predator's Senses | Track players/NPCs, detect nearby creatures |
| 5 | Natural Weapons | Unarmed attacks deal 1d6 + STR |
| 10 | Wild Sprint | -50% travel time for 1 journey (1h cooldown) |

| 25 | Alpha's Howl | Party +2 STR/DEX/CON for 1 hour (24h cooldown) |

**Profession Bonuses:** +35% hunting yield, +25% tanning quality, +20% herbalism yield, +15% ranching speed
**Profession Penalty:** -20% enchanting quality

**Playstyle:** The hunter elite. Beastfolk have the most balanced physical stats of any common race (+2 STR/DEX/CON/WIS) and the 6 clans let you customize your build. Wolf Clan Beastmaster Rangers are thematic perfection. Panther Clan Assassin Rogues get stealth synergy. Wild Sprint at 10 cuts travel time in half, and Apex Predator at 40 makes Beastfolk the best PvE farmers in the game. The -20% enchanting penalty means you will need to trade for enchantments.

---

#### Faefolk

> *"Playing as Faefolk is the game's 'hard mode' for social and economic play."*

| Stat | STR | DEX | CON | INT | WIS | CHA |
|------|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|
| Modifier | -3 | +4 | -2 | +2 | +3 | +3 |

**Trait: Fey Nature** -- Impossibly agile and magically gifted, fragile as glass.

**Homeland:** The Glimmerveil
**Starting Towns:** Glimmerheart, Dewdrop Hollow, Moonpetal Grove
**Exclusive Zone:** Feywild (requires level 40)

**Racial Abilities:**
| Level | Ability | Effect |
|-------|---------|--------|
| 1 | Flutter | Short flight (dodge ground traps, cross water) |
| 5 | Fey Glamour | Disguise as small humanoid, 1 hour (4h cooldown) |
| 10 | Wild Magic Surge | Spells have 10% chance for random bonus effect |
| 15 | Binding Promise | Deal-breakers get -3 all stats for 24 hours (24h cooldown) |
| 25 | Nature's Wrath | Entangle all enemies, 2 turns (12h cooldown) |
| 40 | Feywild Gateway | Open portal to exclusive Feywild zone (48h cooldown) |

**Exclusive Feywild Resources (Level 40+):**
- Moonpetal Flowers (rare alchemical reagent)
- Dreamweave Silk (luxury tailoring material)
- Starlight Dust (enchanting component)
- Fey Iron (unique weapon material)

**Profession Bonuses:** +35% enchanting quality, +30% herbalism yield, +20% alchemy quality
**Profession Penalties:** -25% blacksmithing quality, -25% armoring quality, -25% mining quality, -15% physical crafting speed

**Playstyle:** The extreme specialist. Faefolk have the highest DEX (+4) and tied-highest CHA (+3) in the game, but catastrophic STR (-3) and CON (-2) penalties. You will be fragile in combat but devastating with the right class -- Faefolk Enchanter Mages and Diplomat Bards are exceptional. The Feywild exclusive zone does not unlock until level 40, making Faefolk a slow-burn investment. The profession penalties are severe: -25% to all metal crafting means you are entirely dependent on other races for weapons and armor. For experienced players who want a unique challenge and a powerful endgame.

## Regions and Their Towns

### The Verdant Heartlands (Human)

The political and economic center of Aethermere. Rolling farmlands, prosperous cities, and the seat of human civilization. The safest region for new players.

**Towns:** Kingshold (capital), Millhaven, Bridgewater, Ironford, Whitefield
**Resources:** Grain, livestock, timber, iron, herbs
**Character:** Bustling markets, strong militia, fertile land

### The Silverwood Forest (Elf)

Ancient enchanted forest. Towering trees older than human civilization, moonlit glades, and hidden groves pulsing with arcane energy.

**Towns:** Aelindra (capital), Moonhaven, Thornwatch, Willowmere, Eldergrove
**Resources:** Enchanted wood, rare herbs, moonstone, silverleaf
**Character:** Magical atmosphere, gathering paradise, quiet trade

### The Ironvault Mountains (Dwarf)

A vast mountain range riddled with mines, forges, and underground cities carved from living rock. Magma-lit halls and phosphorescent crystals.

**Towns:** Kazad-Vorn (capital), Deepvein, Hammerfall, Gemhollow, Alehearth
**Resources:** Iron ore, gems, rare metals, stone, deep mine exclusives
**Character:** Master crafting hub, mining economy, underground splendor

### The Crossroads (Halfling)

Where every major trade route in Aethermere intersects. Flat plains dotted with farms, taverns, and bustling market towns. If you want to buy or sell anything, it passes through here.

**Towns:** Hearthshire (capital), Greenhollow, Peddler's Rest, Bramblewood, Riverside
**Resources:** Grain, livestock, trade goods, cooked food, brewed beverages
**Character:** Trade capital, highest marketplace volume, food production hub

### The Ashenfang Wastes (Orc)

Harsh volcanic badlands of ash and obsidian. Only the strong survive here. Home to dangerous monsters and valuable hunting grounds.

**Towns:** Grakthar (capital), Bonepile, Ironfist Hold, Thornback Camp, Ashen Market
**Resources:** Hides, leather, obsidian, beast trophies, war materials
**Character:** Combat-focused, dangerous wildlife, clan politics

### Shadowmere Marshes (Tiefling)

Perpetual twilight over brackish swamps and fog-shrouded islands. A land of secrets, poisons, and dark magic. Not for the faint of heart.

**Towns:** Nethermire (capital), Boghollow, Mistwatch, Cinderkeep, Whispering Docks
**Resources:** Rare herbs, alchemical reagents, shadow crystals, marsh gas
**Character:** Alchemy capital, dark ambiance, information trading

### The Frozen Reaches (Dragonborn)

Glacial tundra and volcanic peaks in the far north. Extremes of fire and ice, with ancient dragon lairs hidden in the mountains.

**Towns:** Drakenspire (capital), Frostfang, Emberpeak, Scalehaven, Wyrmrest
**Resources:** Rare ores, dragon materials, elemental crystals, frost herbs
**Character:** Dangerous but rewarding, high-level content, dragon lore

### Suncoast Free Cities (Half-Elf)

A chain of independent city-states along the southeastern coast where sea breezes carry the scent of salt and opportunity. No single ruler governs the Free Cities -- each city operates independently, bound together by trade agreements and cultural exchange. Half-Elves founded these cities as meeting grounds between Elven and Human cultures, and they remain the most cosmopolitan settlements in Aethermere. You will find every race represented here.

**Towns:** Sunharbor (largest), Coralgate, Starfall, Goldmeadow, Tidewater
**Resources:** Trade goods, enchanted materials, diplomatic services, mixed crafting
**Character:** Cosmopolitan, diplomatic focus, multicultural marketplace

### The Scarred Frontier (Half-Orc)

The war-torn borderlands between the Ashenfang Wastes and the Verdant Heartlands. This contested territory bears the scars of centuries of conflict between Orcs and Humans. Half-Orcs -- belonging fully to neither world -- carved their own settlements here through sheer determination and martial prowess. The Frontier rewards those who prove themselves through action rather than birth.

**Towns:** Duskwall (fortified capital), Flintridge, Greymarsh, Ashford, Ravenswatch
**Resources:** Hides, ore, lumber, mercenary contracts
**Character:** Rough-and-ready, merit-based culture, frontier justice

### Cogsworth Warrens (Gnome)

A marvel of underground engineering. The Warrens extend deep beneath rolling hills, their tunnels lit by phosphorescent lamps and echoing with the sound of clockwork machinery. Every surface is covered with gears, pipes, or experimental apparatus. Explosions are weekly occurrences. The Gnomes wouldn't have it any other way. This is the innovation capital of Aethermere, where tomorrow's inventions are built (and occasionally catch fire) today.

**Towns:** Cogsworth (capital), Tinkerton, Gearspark, Crystalvein, Steamhaven
**Resources:** Engineered goods, alchemical reagents, gems, precision tools
**Character:** Invention hub, experimental crafting, high-quality goods

### The Thornwilds (Beastfolk)

Untamed wilderness between civilized regions. Ancient forests, deep ravines, and trackless swamps where nature has never been tamed. The Beastfolk clans roam these wilds, each clan claiming territory based on their animal nature -- Wolf Clan patrols the forest floor, Hawk Clan nests on the highest ridges, and Panther Clan stalks the deep shadows. Non-Beastfolk travelers pass through at their own risk.

**Towns:** Thornden (clan capital), Clawridge, Windrun
**Resources:** Rare hides, wild herbs, spirit essences, thornbark
**Character:** Wild and dangerous, clan-based society, hunting paradise

### The Glimmerveil (Faefolk)

A borderland between the mortal world and the Feywild, where reality shimmers and shifts like heat haze. Colors are brighter here. Sounds carry strangely. Time flows at a slightly different pace. The Faefolk settlements look like natural formations at first glance -- houses grown from living trees, bridges spun from moonlight, market stalls draped in spider silk that sparkles with morning dew. Beautiful, disorienting, and slightly dangerous.

**Towns:** Glimmerheart (capital), Dewdrop Hollow, Moonpetal Grove
**Resources:** Fey materials (at level 40), enchanting reagents, rare herbs, moonpetals
**Character:** Otherworldly, magical atmosphere, late-game content

### The Skypeak Plateaus (Goliath)

The highest inhabited land in Aethermere. The air is thin, the wind is relentless, and the views are beyond compare. Goliath settlements cling to cliff faces and perch on plateaus where lesser races gasp for breath. Everything here is a competition -- who can climb highest, carry the most, endure the longest. The mountains hold rare ores that can only be extracted from these altitudes.

**Towns:** Skyhold (mountain capital), Windbreak
**Resources:** Cloudstone, sky iron, storm crystals, high-altitude minerals
**Character:** Extreme environment, competitive culture, rare mining

### Vel'Naris / The Underdark (Drow)

A vast network of caverns, tunnels, and underground seas beneath Aethermere. The Drow city of Vel'Naris is a cathedral of stalactites and bioluminescent fungi, ruled by Matriarchs whose power is absolute. Surface-dwellers rarely venture here voluntarily -- the darkness, the spiders, and the Drow themselves are all hostile to the unprepared. But the Underdark holds resources found nowhere else on the surface.

**Towns:** Vel'Naris (Underdark capital), Gloom Market
**Resources:** Darksteel ore, spider silk, gloomcap mushrooms, shadow crystals, underdark pearls
**Character:** Dangerous, hierarchical, exclusive resources

### The Mistwood Glens (Firbolg)

Hidden within the oldest forests, these glens are nearly impossible to find unless a Firbolg guides you. The trees here are ancient beyond measure, their canopy so thick that sunlight reaches the forest floor only in scattered pools. Firbolg settlements blend seamlessly with the forest -- you might walk through one without realizing it. The herbs and plants here grow nowhere else in such abundance or potency.

**Towns:** Misthaven (sanctuary), Rootholme
**Resources:** Ancient heartwood, spirit moss, elderbloom, rare herbs
**Character:** Hidden, nature-focused, premier herbalism

### The Foundry (Warforged)

An ancient ruin from a forgotten civilization, partially restored by the Warforged who call it home. Massive construction bays, arcane power conduits, and repair stations fill this complex. The hum of magical energy is constant. The Foundry is both home and birthplace -- new Warforged are still occasionally activated from dormant construction bays. The Foundry Core, deep within the complex, holds materials unique to Warforged engineering.

**Towns:** The Foundry (sole settlement)
**Resources:** Living steel, power cores, arcane circuits, repair materials
**Character:** Industrial, construct-focused, unique crafting

### The Confluence (Genasi)

Where four elemental rifts converge, creating a landscape of impossible contrasts -- fire meets water, earth meets air. The ground alternates between scorched stone and lush greenery within steps. Genasi gather here to tap the raw elemental power that bleeds through the rifts. Each rift zone favors one element, making it a diverse crafting hub.

**Towns:** The Confluence (nexus), Emberheart
**Resources:** Elemental essences, elemental-infused materials
**Character:** Elemental extremes, specialist crafting

### The Ashenmoor (Revenant)

A blighted landscape where the veil between life and death is permanently torn. Grey sky, dead trees, and an ever-present mist that carries whispers of the departed. The magical battle that created this place left a mark that will never heal. Revenants who die here simply... come back. For the perpetually undying, it is the only place that truly feels like home.

**Towns:** Ashenmoor (sole settlement)
**Resources:** Soul fragments, grave iron, spectral silk
**Character:** Blighted, death-themed, reduced penalties for dying

## Travel

Travel between towns happens in real time. When you begin a journey, your character moves along the route and arrives after the travel time elapses. You can check your travel status at any time.

**Key mechanics:**
- Travel follows predefined routes between connected towns
- Travel time varies by distance
- **War penalty:** Travel time increases by **50%** when traveling through regions at war with your kingdom
- **Capital blockade:** You **cannot** travel to enemy capital cities during wartime
- You cannot craft or engage in combat while traveling
- You can arrive early if the timer has elapsed when you check status

## Exclusive Resource Zones

Eleven races have access to exclusive zones that contain resources unavailable to other races. These zones and their resources are:

| Race | Zone | Notable Resources |
|------|------|-------------------|
| Dwarf | Deep Mines | Deep Iron, Adamantine Ore, Fire Opals |
| Dragonborn | Dragon Lairs | Dragon Scale, Dragonbone, Elemental Crystals |
| Merfolk | Deep Ocean | Deep Sea Iron, Abyssal Pearls, Living Coral, Sea Silk, Leviathan Bone, Tideweave Kelp |
| Beastfolk | Deep Thornwilds | Thornbark, Spirit Amber, Wild Essences |
| Faefolk | Feywild (Lv40) | Fey Crystal, Dreamweave, Starlight Dew |
| Goliath | Sky Peaks | Cloudstone, Sky Iron, Storm Crystal |
| Drow | Underdark | Darksteel Ore, Spider Silk, Gloomcap Mushrooms, Shadow Crystals, Underdark Pearls |
| Firbolg | Deepwood Groves | Ancient Heartwood, Spirit Moss, Elderbloom |
| Warforged | The Foundry Core | Living Steel, Power Cores, Arcane Circuits |
| Genasi | Elemental Rifts | Elemental Essences (varies by sub-race) |
| Revenant | Ashenmoor Deadlands | Soul Fragments, Grave Iron, Spectral Silk |

Items crafted from exclusive resources are among the most valuable in the game. A Merfolk who gathers Abyssal Pearls and sells them to a Gnome jeweler can make enormous profits -- neither can do what the other does best.

# Part 4: Economy and Professions

## The Profession System

Professions are the engine of Aethermere's economy. Every piece of equipment, every potion, every cooked meal is produced by a player with the right profession. There are **28 professions** divided into three categories.

You may learn up to **3 professions** (Humans with the Adaptable Crafter ability can learn 4). Choose wisely -- a good combination of gathering, crafting, and service professions creates a self-sustaining economic loop.

### Gathering Professions (7)

Gathering professions produce raw materials from the world. You travel to resource-rich areas and extract what you need.

| Profession | What You Gather | Best Race |
|-----------|----------------|-----------|
| Mining | Ore, gems, stone | Dwarf (+30% yield) |
| Herbalism | Herbs, reagents, flowers | Firbolg (+40% quality AND yield) |
| Woodcutting | Timber, bark, sap | Elf (+15% woodworking quality) |
| Hunting | Hides, meat, bones, trophies | Orc (+30% yield) |
| Fishing | Fish, shells, pearls | Merfolk (underwater access) |
| Farming | Grain, vegetables, cotton | Halfling (+15% yield) |
| Ranching | Livestock, wool, milk, eggs | Orc (+15% speed) |

### Crafting Professions (14)

Crafting professions transform raw materials into finished goods. Each profession has its own recipes, quality system, and market niche.

| Profession | What You Make | Key Materials | Best Race |
|-----------|-------------- |---------------|-----------|
| Blacksmithing | Weapons, tools | Metal ingots | Dwarf (+25% quality) |
| Armoring | Armor, shields | Metal ingots, leather | Dwarf (+25% quality) |
| Leatherworking | Light armor, bags | Tanned hides | Orc (+20% quality) |
| Woodworking | Bows, staves, furniture | Timber | Elf (+15% quality) |
| Alchemy | Potions, poisons, elixirs | Herbs, reagents | Tiefling (+30% quality) |
| Enchanting | Magical enhancements | Crystals, essences | Elf/Tiefling (+20% quality) |
| Cooking | Stat-boosting meals | Ingredients, spices | Halfling (+25% quality) |
| Brewing | Buff beverages | Grains, hops, fruit | Halfling (+20% quality) |
| Tailoring | Cloth armor, cloaks | Cloth, silk, thread | Faefolk |
| Jewelcrafting | Rings, amulets, gems | Gems, precious metals | Gnome |
| Smelting | Metal ingots from ore | Raw ore | Dwarf (+20% speed) |
| Tanning | Processed leather from hides | Raw hides | Orc (+20% quality) |
| Scribing | Scrolls, spell books | Ink, paper, essences | Tiefling (+15% quality) |
| Masonry | Building materials, stonework | Stone, morite | Dwarf (+15% quality) |

### Service Professions (7)

Service professions provide ongoing benefits rather than physical goods.

| Profession | What You Do |
|-----------|------------|
| Trading | Buy low, sell high -- marketplace expertise |
| Banking | Manage loans and interest |
| Innkeeping | Run taverns for rest bonuses |
| Stablemastery | Breed and train mounts |
| Cartography | Map routes for faster travel |
| Mercenary Work | Contract combat services |
| Governance | Political administration bonuses |

## Profession Leveling

Professions level from **1 to 100**, divided into 6 tiers. Higher tiers unlock better recipes, improved quality chances, and access to rarer materials.

| Tier | Level Range | What Unlocks |
|------|------------|-------------|
| Apprentice | 1-10 | Basic recipes, common materials |
| Journeyman | 11-25 | Intermediate recipes, uncommon materials |
| Craftsman | 26-50 | Advanced recipes, rare materials |
| Expert | 51-75 | Expert recipes, regional specialties |
| Master | 76-90 | Master recipes, exclusive patterns |
| Grandmaster | 91-100 | Legendary recipes, unique creations |

Profession XP is earned by performing profession activities. Crafting an item awards XP based on the recipe difficulty. Each profession level also requires `level * 100` XP to advance (e.g., level 10 to 11 requires 1000 XP). When you gain enough XP, you level up and your tier may advance.

**Crafting speed bonus:** Your craft time is reduced by **2% per profession level**. A level 50 blacksmith crafts items in half the time of a level 1 apprentice.

## The Quality System

When you finish crafting an item, a **quality roll** determines how good it turns out. Higher quality items are more effective, more durable, and worth more gold.

### Quality Roll Formula

```
Quality Roll = d20 + (Profession Level / 5) + Tool Bonus + Workshop Bonus + Racial Bonuses
```

| Component | Range | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| d20 | 1-20 | Base random roll |
| Profession Level / 5 | 0-20 | Higher level = higher floor |
| Tool Bonus | 0-5 | Better tools = better results |
| Workshop Bonus | 0-5 | Workshop level 1-5 |
| Racial Bonuses | Varies | E.g., Dwarf +3 to Blacksmith/Armorer |

### Quality Tiers

| Quality | Roll Needed | Sell Multiplier | Durability Multiplier |
|---------|------------|----------------|----------------------|
| Poor | 1-5 | 0.5x | 60% |
| Common | 6-10 | 1.0x | 100% |
| Fine | 11-15 | 1.5x | 120% |
| Superior | 16-20 | 2.5x | 150% |
| Masterwork | 21-25 | 4.0x | 200% |
| Legendary | 26+ | 8.0x | 300% |

> **Example:** A level 50 Dwarven Blacksmith (+25% quality bonus, Master Forger +3) using Expert tools (+3) in a level 3 workshop (+3) rolls: d20 + 10 + 3 + 3 + 3 = d20 + 19. Even rolling a 1, they produce a Superior item. Rolling a 7+, they hit Masterwork. Rolling a high number pushes into Legendary territory.

### Gnome Crafting Special

Gnomes get a unique bonus: **Tinker's Insight** gives a 15% chance to upgrade an item's quality tier after crafting. Their **Eureka Moment** ability (once per day) lets them re-craft a single item with a guaranteed quality upgrade. This makes Gnomes the most consistent producers of high-quality goods.

## Resource Chains

Raw materials must be processed through multiple professions before becoming finished goods. Here are some example chains:

**Iron Sword:**
Mining (ore) -> Smelting (iron ingots) -> Blacksmithing (iron sword)

**Healing Potion:**
Herbalism (herbs) -> Alchemy (healing potion)

**Leather Armor:**
Hunting (hides) -> Tanning (leather) -> Leatherworking (leather armor)

**Enchanted Staff:**
Woodcutting (timber) -> Woodworking (oak staff) -> Enchanting (enchanted oak staff)

**Cooked Feast:**
Farming (grain, vegetables) + Ranching (meat) -> Cooking (hearty feast)

**War Horse:**
Ranching (horse) -> Stablemastery (trained war horse)

## Item Durability

All equipment has durability that decreases with use. When durability reaches zero, the item breaks and becomes unusable until repaired.

- Quality affects durability: **Poor items have 60%** base durability, **Legendary items have 300%**
- Repair costs scale with item level and quality
- **Death penalty:** Equipment loses durability when you die in combat
- Warforged characters need Repair Kits instead of food (see Part 9)

## The Marketplace

The marketplace is a player-driven trading system. Players list items for sale at a price they choose, and other players can buy them.

**Key mechanics:**
- Prices are set by players (supply and demand)
- **Tax rate** is set by town leadership (0-25%)
- Halflings get Silver Tongue: buy 5% cheaper, sell 5% more
- Halfling Trade Network (level 25): see prices in ALL towns
- PvP wagers have a 5% tax deducted from winnings
- Trading profession levels improve your buying/selling efficiency

## Money-Making Tips

1. **Gather exclusive resources.** If you are a Dwarf, Merfolk, or Drow, your exclusive zone resources are always in demand and cannot be obtained by other races.

2. **Pick complementary professions.** A self-sufficient chain (e.g., Mining + Smelting + Blacksmithing) lets you sell finished goods instead of raw materials for much higher profit.

3. **Invest in tools and workshops.** The quality roll bonus from better tools and workshops pays for itself many times over -- a Masterwork item sells for 8x a Common one.

4. **Cook and brew.** Food buffs are consumable, meaning constant demand. Halfling cooks can make steady income with relatively low investment.

5. **Play the market.** Buy cheap in one town, sell expensive in another. Halfling Trade Network makes this trivially easy.

# Part 5: Combat

## PvE Combat (Player vs. Environment)

PvE combat is the primary way to earn XP, gold, and loot. You fight monsters that spawn in the region around your current town.

### Starting a Fight

Travel to a town and initiate combat. The game matches you against a monster appropriate for the region and your level. Monster difficulty scales -- the Verdant Heartlands have Giant Rats and Goblins, while the Frozen Reaches have Dire Wolves and Young Dragons.

### Turn Structure

Combat is **turn-based**. Each round:

1. **Your Turn:** Choose an action:
   - **Weapon Attack:** Roll d20 + STR modifier (melee) or d20 + DEX modifier (ranged) vs. monster's AC. On hit, deal weapon damage + stat modifier.
   - **Use Ability:** Activate a class ability (costs mana, may have cooldown).
   - **Use Item:** Consume a potion, food, or other consumable.
   - **Flee:** Attempt to escape combat (not always successful).

2. **Monster Turn:** The monster attacks automatically. Monster AI targets randomly among living enemies.

3. **Resolution:** Damage is applied, status effects tick, cooldowns decrease. Combat continues until one side is defeated or you flee.

### Attack Rolls

```
Attack Roll = d20 + Stat Modifier + Equipment Bonuses
```

If the roll meets or exceeds the target's **Armor Class (AC)**, the attack hits. On hit, you deal damage based on your weapon plus stat modifiers.

### Victory Rewards

When you defeat a monster:

| Reward | Formula |
|--------|---------|
| XP | Monster Level x 25 |
| Gold | Varies by monster loot table |
| Items | Random drops based on loot table |

> **Example:** Defeating a Level 8 Skeleton Warrior awards 200 XP (8 x 25) plus gold and potential item drops.

### Death

If your HP reaches zero, you are defeated. Death carries penalties:

- **Gold loss:** You lose a percentage of your carried gold
- **XP loss:** You lose some XP (but never below your current level threshold)
- **Durability loss:** Your equipped items lose durability
- **Revenant bonus:** Revenants take only 50% of these penalties and respawn at 50% HP

### Status Effects

Combat abilities can apply various status effects. Understanding these is key to both dealing and surviving damage.

| Status | Effect | Common Sources |
|--------|--------|---------------|
| Stun | Cannot take any action | Shield Bash (Guardian) |
| Slow | Reduced dodge, lower initiative | Frost Lance (Elementalist) |
| Root | Cannot flee, reduced defense | Snare (Tracker) |
| Silence | Cannot cast spells/use abilities | Silence (Inquisitor) |
| Poison DoT | Takes damage each round | Poison Blade (Assassin), monster attacks |
| Frighten | -2 to attack rolls | Frightful Presence (Dragonborn) |
| Mesmerize | Cannot act, breaks on damage | Enthrall (Diplomat) |
| Polymorph | Transformed, cannot act | Polymorph (Enchanter) |
| Prone | -2 AC until standing | Earthshaker (Goliath), Tsunami Strike (Merfolk) |
| Taunt | Forced to attack taunter | Taunt (Guardian) |

### Combat Tips

- **Use abilities on cooldown.** Mana regenerates; unused cooldowns are wasted damage or healing.
- **Open with your strongest ability.** Tracker's Master Tracker (first strike always crits) and Panther Clan's Shadow Pounce (2x stealth damage) reward going first.
- **Manage your health thresholds.** Orc Blood Fury (+25% damage below 50% HP) and Dwarf Ancestral Fury (+5 STR/CON below 25% HP) are triggered by low health. Sometimes taking damage is strategic.
- **Counter enemy types.** Paladins destroy undead (Consecrate does 2x damage to undead). Inquisitors shut down mages (Silence + Purging Flame). Guardians nullify physical attackers (Shield Wall + Iron Bulwark).
- **Know when to flee.** Death penalties are real. If a fight is going badly and you lack a "cheat death" ability, Disengage (Thief, 90% success) or Diplomat's Gambit (50% peaceful end) can save you.

### Monster Difficulty by Region

| Region | Common Monsters | Level Range |
|--------|----------------|-------------|
| Verdant Heartlands | Giant Rats, Goblins, Wolves | 1-5 |
| The Crossroads | Goblins, Bandits | 1-4 |
| Silverwood Forest | Wolves, Forest Spiders | 2-6 |
| Ironvault Mountains | Giant Spiders, Golems | 5-12 |
| Ashenfang Wastes | Orc Warriors, Trolls | 5-10 |
| Shadowmere Marshes | Skeleton Warriors, Trolls | 5-10 |
| Frozen Reaches | Dire Wolves, Young Dragons | 10-16+ |

### Recommended Leveling Path

For efficient progression, follow this monster difficulty curve:

1. **Level 1-3:** Verdant Heartlands or The Crossroads. Giant Rats (25 XP), Goblins (25-50 XP). Safe, fast kills.
2. **Level 3-5:** Stay in Heartlands for Wolves (75 XP) and Bandits (75-100 XP). Accept the main quest chain.
3. **Level 5-7:** Ironvault Mountains or Shadowmere Marshes. Giant Spiders (125 XP), Skeleton Warriors (125 XP).
4. **Level 7-10:** Ashenfang Wastes for Orc Warriors (175-200 XP). Begin bounty quests.
5. **Level 10-12:** Choose your specialization. Push into harder content with your new abilities.
6. **Level 12-16:** Frozen Reaches for Dire Wolves (300 XP) and Young Dragons (500+ XP). Complete the main quest chain.
7. **Level 16+:** Post-campaign content. PvP dueling, political ambitions, crafting empires, and endgame zone farming.

---

## PvP Combat (Player vs. Player)

Test your mettle against other players in sanctioned duels.

### Challenging a Duel

To challenge another player to a PvP duel:

1. Both players must be in the **same town**
2. Level difference cannot exceed **5 levels** (a Level 10 can duel Level 5-15)
3. 30-minute cooldown between duels with the same player
4. You can optionally set a **gold wager** -- winner takes all (minus 5% tax)

### Duel Flow

1. **Challenge:** You issue a challenge to another player, optionally wagering gold.
2. **Accept/Decline:** The challenged player can accept or decline. No penalty for declining.
3. **Combat:** Same turn-based system as PvE. Both players take turns using attacks, abilities, and items.
4. **Resolution:** The last player standing wins.

### PvP Rewards

| Reward | Amount |
|--------|--------|
| XP | 50 x Opponent's Level |
| Gold Wager | Winner's wager + Loser's wager - 5% tax |
| Leaderboard Rating | Adjusted based on outcome |

> **Example:** Defeating a Level 20 opponent awards 1000 XP (50 x 20). If both wagered 500 gold, the winner receives 950 gold (1000 - 5% tax).

### After the Duel

Both players are healed to full HP and mana after every duel, win or lose. Equipment durability is not affected by PvP duels.

### PvP Leaderboard

Your PvP wins and losses are tracked on a global leaderboard. Climbing the leaderboard earns bragging rights and unlocks PvP achievements (Duelist, Gladiator, Warlord titles).

---

# Part 6: Leveling and Progression

## The XP Curve

XP requirements increase with each level. The formula is straightforward:

**XP to next level = Current Level x 100**

| Level | XP for Next Level | Cumulative XP |
|-------|-------------------|---------------|
| 1 -> 2 | 100 | 100 |
| 2 -> 3 | 200 | 300 |
| 3 -> 4 | 300 | 600 |
| 4 -> 5 | 400 | 1,000 |
| 5 -> 6 | 500 | 1,500 |
| 10 -> 11 | 1,000 | 5,500 |
| 15 -> 16 | 1,500 | 12,000 |
| 20 -> 21 | 2,000 | 21,000 |
| 25 -> 26 | 2,500 | 32,500 |
| 30 -> 31 | 3,000 | 46,500 |
| 40 -> 41 | 4,000 | 82,000 |
| 50 -> 51 | 5,000 | 127,500 |

**Cumulative XP formula:** Total XP to reach level L = `100 * (L-1) * L / 2`

## Level-Up Rewards

Every time you level up, you receive:

| Reward | Amount Per Level |
|--------|-----------------|
| Unspent Stat Points | +2 |
| Unspent Skill Points | +1 |
| Max Health | +10 |
| Max Mana | +5 |
| Full Heal | HP and Mana restored to new maximum |

> **Example:** Reaching level 20 means you have gained 38 stat points (2 per level from 2-20) and 19 skill points to distribute.

## Key Level Milestones

| Level | What Happens |
|-------|-------------|
| 1 | Character creation. First racial ability unlocks. |
| 5 | Second racial ability unlocks. |
| 10 | **Choose your specialization.** Third racial ability. First 2 class abilities available. |
| 14-16 | Tier 2 class abilities unlock. |
| 15 | Fourth racial ability. |
| 20-22 | Tier 3 class abilities unlock. |
| 25 | Fifth racial ability. |
| 30 | Tier 4 class abilities unlock. |
| 40 | **Tier 5 capstone ability.** Sixth racial ability. |

## Racial Ability Unlock Schedule

Every race gets 6 racial abilities that unlock at fixed levels:

| Unlock Level | Ability Slot |
|-------------|-------------|
| Level 1 | Starting racial ability (always available) |
| Level 5 | Second racial ability |
| Level 10 | Third racial ability |
| Level 15 | Fourth racial ability |
| Level 25 | Fifth racial ability |
| Level 40 | Capstone racial ability |

## Skill Trees

At level 10, you choose a specialization within your class. This grants access to a tree of 6 abilities across 5 tiers:

- **Tier 1 (Level 10):** Your entry ability. Always available once you pick the specialization.
- **Tier 2 (Level 14-16):** Two abilities that branch from Tier 1.
- **Tier 3 (Level 20-22):** Intermediate abilities requiring Tier 2 prerequisites.
- **Tier 4 (Level 30):** Powerful abilities that define your build.
- **Tier 5 (Level 40):** Your capstone -- a passive ability that permanently enhances your character.

Each ability has a prerequisite. You must learn the lower-tier ability before unlocking the next one in the chain.

## XP Sources

| Source | XP Amount |
|--------|-----------|
| PvE Combat Victory | Monster Level x 25 |
| PvP Duel Victory | 50 x Opponent Level |
| Crafting | Recipe XP reward (varies) |
| Main Quests | 100 - 5,000 (see quest list) |
| Town Quests | 100 - 400 |
| Daily Quests | 100 - 300 |
| Guild Quests | 500 - 800 |
| Bounty Quests | 400 - 2,000 |
| Achievements | 25 - 2,000 |

### XP Boosting

Several abilities and effects increase XP gain:

- **Human Versatile Learner:** +10% profession XP (all professions)
- **Elf Ageless Knowledge:** +15% XP for Enchanter, Herbalist, Scribe (level 25)
- **Tiefling Dark Knowledge:** +20% XP for Alchemy and Enchanting (level 10)
- **Bard Lorekeeper Recall Lore:** +15% combat XP (level 14)
- **Bard Lorekeeper Omniscient:** +25% XP from ALL sources (level 40)

> **Pro Tip:** A Half-Elf Lorekeeper Bard who picked Versatile Learner (Human ability via Versatile Heritage) stacks +10% profession XP, +15% combat XP, and eventually +25% all XP. This is the fastest-leveling build in the game.

## Quests

# Part 7: Politics and Governance

Aethermere is not just a world of swords and spells -- it is a world of crowns. The political system lets players govern towns, pass laws, levy taxes, and wage war. Every town has a mayor. Every kingdom has a ruler. These positions are filled by players through elections.

## Elections

### Mayor Elections

Any resident of a town can nominate themselves (or be nominated) for mayor. Elections follow a two-phase process:

1. **Nomination Phase:** Candidates declare their intent to run. Any player residing in the town can nominate.
2. **Voting Phase:** All town residents vote for their preferred candidate. One player, one vote.

The candidate with the most votes becomes mayor.

### Ruler Elections

Kingdom-level elections work differently. Only **sitting mayors** can run for ruler. Only **mayors within the kingdom** can vote. This creates a representative democracy -- you elect your local mayor, and mayors elect the ruler.

### Term Limits

- A leader may serve a maximum of **3 consecutive terms**
- After 3 terms, they must sit out at least one election cycle before running again
- There is no lifetime limit -- you can be re-elected after your mandatory break

### Impeachment

If a leader is performing poorly, citizens can initiate an impeachment:

1. **Filing:** Any citizen can file an impeachment motion
2. **Voting Period:** A 48-hour voting window opens
3. **Resolution:** If a majority votes to impeach, the leader is removed from office
4. **Succession:** A new election is triggered automatically

## Governance Powers

Once elected, leaders have real power over their domain.

### Mayor Powers

| Power | Description |
|-------|------------|
| Set Tax Rate | 0-25% tax on marketplace transactions in your town |
| Propose Laws | Submit laws for council vote (tax, trade, military, building, general) |
| Vote on Laws | Cast your vote on proposed laws |
| Appoint Officials | Assign players to governance roles |
| Allocate Treasury | Spend town treasury funds on improvements |

### Ruler Powers

| Power | Description |
|-------|------------|
| All Mayor Powers | Everything a mayor can do, kingdom-wide |
| Declare War | Initiate war against another kingdom |
| Propose Peace | Offer peace terms to end a war |
| Kingdom Treasury | Manage the kingdom's central treasury |
| Set Kingdom Laws | Laws that affect all towns in the kingdom |

## Law System

Leaders can propose 5 types of laws:

| Law Type | Examples |
|----------|---------|
| Tax | Adjust tax rates, implement progressive taxation |
| Trade | Set trade embargoes, establish trade agreements |
| Military | Conscription rules, militia funding, war declarations |
| Building | Authorize construction, workshop subsidies |
| General | Curfews, citizenship rules, guild regulations |

### How Laws Pass

1. A leader proposes a law
2. Council members (other mayors in the kingdom) vote
3. A law passes when it receives **3+ votes** with a **majority in favor**
4. Passed laws are automatically activated and enforced

## War and Diplomacy

### Declaring War

Only rulers can declare war. When war is declared:

- **Travel time increases by 50%** through enemy territory
- **Enemy capital cities become inaccessible** -- you cannot travel there
- Trade between warring kingdoms is disrupted
- Players in enemy territory may face additional penalties

### Proposing Peace

Either side can propose peace at any time. Peace proposals must be accepted by the opposing ruler. Until peace is agreed upon, war penalties remain in effect.

### Strategic Implications

War is not just flavor text -- it has real mechanical consequences:

- **Traders** lose access to enemy markets, disrupting supply chains
- **Travelers** spend 50% more time on routes through enemy territory
- **Crafters** who depend on resources from enemy regions must find alternative suppliers
- **Politicians** must weigh the economic costs of war against territorial goals

> **Example:** If the Dwarven kingdom declares war on the Orc kingdom, a Halfling trader who regularly buys leather from Ashen Market will find their travel time increased and may lose access to Orc capital goods entirely. The smart trader stockpiles leather before war breaks out -- or finds a Beastfolk leatherworker instead.

## Tax Rates

Town tax rates affect every marketplace transaction in that town. The rate ranges from **0% to 25%**.

- **Low taxes (0-5%):** Attract merchants and trading activity. Good for small towns wanting to grow.
- **Medium taxes (6-15%):** Balance revenue with marketplace activity. The sweet spot for most towns.
- **High taxes (16-25%):** Generate maximum revenue but may drive traders to lower-tax towns.

Tax revenue goes into the town treasury, which the mayor can allocate for improvements, military, or other purposes.

# Part 8: Social Systems

## Guilds

Guilds are player-created organizations for cooperation, resource sharing, and group activities.

### Creating a Guild

- **Cost:** 500 gold
- **Requirements:** Any player can create a guild
- **Naming:** Choose a unique guild name

### Guild Ranks

| Rank | Permissions |
|------|------------|
| Member | Basic guild access, chat, view guild info |
| Officer | Invite new members, kick members |
| Co-Leader | All officer powers + promote members, manage guild settings |
| Leader | All powers including disband, transfer leadership |

### Guild Features

**Invitations:** Officers and above can invite players. Invited players can join from anywhere.

**Treasury:** Members can donate gold to the guild treasury. The leader and co-leaders manage treasury spending.

**Guild Quests:** Guild members can take on guild-specific quests that award reputation in addition to XP and gold (see Part 6).

**Promotion:** Leaders can promote members through the ranks: Member -> Officer -> Co-Leader.

**Leadership Transfer:** The guild leader can transfer leadership to another member.

**Disbanding:** Only the leader can disband a guild. This is permanent.

### Dwarven Clan Loyalty

Dwarves have the unique racial ability **Clan Loyalty** (level 25): all same-race guild members receive a +5% crafting bonus. A guild of Dwarven smiths is strictly better than individual Dwarven smiths working alone.

## Friends System

Add other players as friends to see when they are online, quickly message them, and find them for duels or trading.

- **Achievement:** Adding your first friend earns the "Making Friends" achievement (25 XP)
- **Achievement:** Having 10 friends earns "Social Butterfly" (200 XP + title)

## Player Profiles

Your profile displays your character information to other players:

- Race, class, and specialization
- Level and notable achievements
- Guild membership
- PvP leaderboard ranking
- Titles earned from achievements

# Part 9: Exotic Race Deep Dives

Exotic races offer the most unique gameplay experiences in Realm of Crowns. Each has powerful abilities balanced by significant trade-offs. They are not recommended for first-time players, but for veterans who want a distinctive challenge, they are unmatched.

---

## Changeling -- The Shapeshifter

> *"If you need to know something, find a Changeling. If you can."*

| Stat | STR | DEX | CON | INT | WIS | CHA |
|------|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|
| Modifier | +0 | +2 | +0 | +2 | +1 | +4 |

**Trait: Shapechanger** -- Supreme social manipulators with fluid identity.

**Homeland:** Everywhere and Nowhere
**Starting Towns:** None (you choose ANY town in the game)
**Exclusive Zone:** None

**What Makes Changelings Unique:**

Changelings are the only race with no hometown. At character creation, you pick any town on the map as your starting point. You receive no racial majority penalties anywhere because you can look like you belong. The trade-off: no safe home base, no exclusive resource zone, and no guaranteed allies.

**Racial Abilities:**
| Level | Ability | Effect |
|-------|---------|--------|
| 1 | Change Appearance | Shift appearance to any race/gender (cosmetic only at first) |
| 5 | Unsettling Visage | Force attacker to reroll a hit (1/combat) |
| 10 | Perfect Mimicry | Appearance shift fools NPCs -- they treat you as the race you appear |
| 15 | Identity Theft | Copy a specific player's appearance (24h cooldown) |
| 25 | The Veil's Network | Access Changeling spy network: buy intel on any player or town |
| 40 | Thousand Faces | Shift appearance mid-combat, +3 AC for 1 turn after each shift |

**The Veil Network (Level 25):**

At level 25, Changelings unlock the Veil Network -- a secret espionage marketplace. Here you can:
- Buy intelligence on any player (gear, stats, location)
- Sell information you have gathered
- Take espionage contracts for gold and reputation

This makes Changelings the ultimate information brokers. In a game with player-driven politics, knowing who has what and where they are is worth more than any sword.

**Profession Bonuses:** +30% merchant yield, +25% courier speed, +20% innkeeper yield, +15% all social professions

**Best Classes:** Bard (Diplomat), Rogue (Assassin or Thief)

**Playstyle:** The spy, the infiltrator, the information broker. Changelings excel at social manipulation, espionage, and marketplace mastery. They are the weakest in direct combat but the most dangerous in the political game. If you want to play a character who wins through knowledge rather than strength, Changeling is your race.

## Warforged -- The Living Construct

> *"Other races aren't sure whether to treat them as people or tools -- a source of deep tension."*

| Stat | STR | DEX | CON | INT | WIS | CHA |
|------|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|
| Modifier | +2 | +0 | +3 | +2 | +0 | -2 |

**Trait: Living Construct** -- Does not eat, sleep, or breathe. Repaired, not healed.

**Homeland:** The Foundry
**Starting Towns:** The Foundry
**Exclusive Zone:** The Foundry Core

**What Makes Warforged Unique:**

Warforged are sentient constructs -- beings of metal, wood, and arcane energy. Their core mechanic is the Living Construct trait:

- **No food or rest needed:** You save gold on food and inn stays.
- **Immune to poison, disease, and sleep effects:** Several monster abilities become useless against you.
- **Repair Kits required:** Instead of food, you need Repair Kits (crafted by Blacksmiths). Without maintenance, your stats degrade at **-1% per day unmaintained**.
- **Cannot be a Healer:** Warforged do not understand biological healing. The Healer specialization is locked.
- **-30% cooking and brewing quality:** You cannot taste what you make.

**Racial Abilities:**
| Level | Ability | Effect |
|-------|---------|--------|
| 1 | Constructed Resilience | Immune to poison, disease, sleep. No food/rest needed. |
| 5 | Integrated Armor | +1 AC, armor integrated into body (cannot be disarmed) |
| 10 | Tireless Worker | No fatigue, +50% more crafting/gathering actions |
| 15 | Self-Repair | Heal 30% max HP using repair materials (8h cooldown) |
| 25 | Overclock | Double crafting/gathering speed for 1 hour (10% risk of temp stat loss) |
| 40 | Siege Mode | Root in place: +5 AC, +50% ranged damage, 3 turns (1/combat) |

**Profession Bonuses:** +25% smelting quality, +25% all crafting speed, +20% mining yield, +15% masonry quality
**Profession Penalties:** -30% cooking quality, -30% brewing quality, -20% herbalism quality

**Best Classes:** Warrior (Guardian), Ranger (Sharpshooter), Mage (any)

**Playstyle:** The ultimate crafter and tank. Warforged Tireless Worker (+50% actions) combined with Overclock (2x speed) makes them the highest-throughput crafters in the game. In combat, Integrated Armor and Siege Mode create an unkillable ranged fortress. The maintenance requirement is the key trade-off -- keep your Repair Kits stocked or watch your stats slowly degrade.

---

## Drow (Dark Elves) -- The Underdark Master

> *"Their skin turned obsidian, their hair moonwhite, and their magic turned to shadow and poison."*

| Stat | STR | DEX | CON | INT | WIS | CHA |
|------|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|
| Modifier | +0 | +3 | +0 | +2 | +1 | +2 |

**Trait: Shadowborn** -- Agile and magically potent, weakened by direct sunlight.

**Homeland:** Vel'Naris (Underdark)
**Starting Towns:** Vel'Naris, Gloom Market
**Exclusive Zone:** Underdark

**What Makes Drow Unique:**

The defining Drow mechanic is **Sunlight Sensitivity**: -2 to attack rolls and perception checks in direct sunlight. This is an always-on penalty that affects surface combat and gathering during daytime. The compensation: access to the Underdark, one of the richest exclusive zones in the game.

**Underdark Exclusive Resources:**
- Darksteel Ore (superior to standard metals)
- Spider Silk (premium tailoring material)
- Gloomcap Mushrooms (potent alchemical reagent)
- Shadow Crystals (enchanting component)
- Underdark Pearls (jewelry crafting)

**Racial Abilities:**
| Level | Ability | Effect |
|-------|---------|--------|
| 1 | Superior Darkvision | See in darkness, access Underdark zones |
| 5 | Sunlight Sensitivity | -2 attack/perception in sunlight (passive penalty) |
| 5 | Drow Magic | Cast Darkness spell: 15ft radius, extinguish light (8h cooldown) |
| 10 | Poison Mastery | +25% poison damage, crafted poisons 30% more potent |
| 15 | Web Walker | Move through webs freely, access spider-silk nodes |
| 25 | Shadow Step | Teleport 30ft between shadows, next attack has advantage (1/combat) |
| 40 | Matriarch's/Patriarch's Command | Dominate hostile NPC for 1 combat (24h cooldown) |

**Profession Bonuses:** +30% alchemy quality, +25% tailoring quality, +20% enchanting quality, +20% mining yield
**Profession Penalty:** -10% speed on all daytime activities

**Best Classes:** Rogue (Assassin), Mage (Necromancer or Enchanter)

**Playstyle:** High risk, high reward. Drow players must plan around Sunlight Sensitivity -- fighting at night, gathering underground, or using Drow Magic to create their own darkness. In exchange, they have the best poison crafting in the game and access to Underdark resources that sell for premium prices. The Assassin Rogue / Drow combination is one of the most lethal PvP builds if you fight in favorable conditions.

---

## Firbolg -- The Nature Guardian

> *"They are the most powerful druids and healers in existence."*

| Stat | STR | DEX | CON | INT | WIS | CHA |
|------|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|
| Modifier | +2 | +0 | +2 | +0 | +4 | +0 |

**Trait: Nature's Guardian** -- Immense wisdom and connection to the natural world.

**Homeland:** The Mistwood Glens
**Starting Towns:** Misthaven, Rootholme
**Exclusive Zone:** Deepwood Groves

**What Makes Firbolgs Unique:**

Firbolgs have the highest WIS in the game (+4) and the most extreme profession bonuses: **+40% herbalism quality AND +40% herbalism yield**. No other race comes close to their gathering efficiency. They can speak to animals and plants, unlocking unique quests unavailable to other races.

The trade-off: -25% mining quality, -25% mining yield, -25% smelting quality, and -20% building speed. Firbolgs are terrible at anything involving stone or metal.

**Racial Abilities:**
| Level | Ability | Effect |
|-------|---------|--------|
| 1 | Speech of Beast and Leaf | Communicate with animals and plants (unique quests) |
| 5 | Hidden Step | Turn invisible until next turn or until you attack (4h cooldown) |
| 10 | Druidic Magic | Nature spells cost 25% less mana, deal 20% more damage |
| 15 | Nature's Bounty | +30% yield on ALL gathering in natural areas |
| 25 | Powerful Build | Carry capacity doubled |
| 40 | Guardian Form | Transform into Treant: massive HP/STR, nature AoE (24h cooldown) |

**Profession Bonuses:** +40% herbalism quality, +40% herbalism yield, +30% farming yield, +25% cooking quality, +20% healing quality
**Profession Penalties:** -25% mining quality/yield, -25% smelting quality, -20% building speed

**Best Classes:** Cleric (Healer or Paladin), Ranger (Beastmaster)

**Playstyle:** The herbalist supreme and the best Healer in the game. Firbolg herbalists produce 40% more herbs of 40% higher quality than anyone else -- they dominate the potion supply chain. Guardian Form at 40 transforms you into a literal tree monster. Firbolgs cannot do anything with metal, so partner with a Dwarven blacksmith who needs your herbs.

---

## Goliath -- The Mountain Titan

> *"Not out of cruelty, but because in the merciless heights, only the strong survive."*

| Stat | STR | DEX | CON | INT | WIS | CHA |
|------|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|
| Modifier | +4 | +0 | +4 | -1 | +1 | -2 |

**Trait: Mountain Born** -- Immense physical power, adapted to extreme environments.

**Homeland:** The Skypeak Plateaus
**Starting Towns:** Skyhold, Windbreak
**Exclusive Zone:** Sky Peaks

**What Makes Goliaths Unique:**

Goliaths have the highest combined STR+CON in the game (+4/+4, total +8 physical stats). They are the tankiest race by far. Powerful Build lets them wield two-handed weapons in one hand. Competitive Spirit gives +20% XP from any activity another Goliath did that week.

The trade-off: -20% quality on finesse crafting (jeweling, scribing, tailoring) and the lowest CHA (-2) among exotic races.

**Racial Abilities:**
| Level | Ability | Effect |
|-------|---------|--------|
| 1 | Stone's Endurance | Reduce damage from one attack by 1d12 + CON |
| 5 | Powerful Build | Double carry capacity, wield 2H weapons in one hand |
| 10 | Mountain's Embrace | Immune to cold damage, no extreme weather penalties |
| 15 | Competitive Spirit | +20% XP from activities another Goliath did this week |
| 25 | Earthshaker | Stomp: AoE 2d6, DEX save or prone, 10ft radius (1/combat) |
| 40 | Titan's Grip | Passive: +1d8 melee damage permanently |

**Profession Bonuses:** +35% mining yield, +25% masonry quality, +20% hunting yield
**Profession Penalties:** -20% jeweling quality, -20% scribing quality, -20% tailoring quality

**Best Classes:** Warrior (Berserker or Guardian), Cleric (Paladin)

**Playstyle:** Pure physical dominance. Goliaths are the best tanks and melee DPS in the game. Titan's Grip at 40 adds 1d8 to every melee hit permanently. On the economic side, they are the best miners in the game (+35% yield), making them ideal Mining + Smelting + Blacksmithing characters. Just don't ask them to make jewelry.

---

## Genasi -- The Elemental Soul

> *"Genasi are walking fonts of elemental magic."*

| Stat | STR | DEX | CON | INT | WIS | CHA |
|------|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|
| Modifier | +1 | +1 | +1 | +2 | +1 | +1 |

**Trait: Elemental Soul** -- Balanced with strong elemental affinity.

**Homeland:** The Confluence
**Starting Towns:** The Confluence, Emberheart
**Exclusive Zone:** Elemental Rifts

**What Makes Genasi Unique:**

Genasi come in 4 sub-races, each attuned to a different element. Your element determines your resistance, bonus stats, and crafting specialties.

**Sub-Races:**

| Sub-Race | Bonus Stat | Element | Resistance | Crafting Specialty |
|----------|-----------|---------|------------|-------------------|
| Fire Genasi | CHA +2 | Fire | Fire | +25% smelting speed, +20% blacksmithing |
| Water Genasi | WIS +2 | Water | Cold | +25% alchemy potency, +20% brewing |
| Earth Genasi | CON +2 | Earth | Bludgeoning | +25% masonry, +20% mining yield |
| Air Genasi | DEX +2 | Air | Lightning | +25% fletching, +20% enchanting |

**Racial Abilities:**
| Level | Ability | Effect |
|-------|---------|--------|
| 1 | Elemental Resistance | Half damage from your element |
| 5 | Elemental Cantrip | 1d6 matching element damage |
| 10 | Elemental Infusion | Items you craft gain +10% elemental damage |
| 15 | Planar Attunement | +25% gathering yield at elemental rift zones |
| 25 | Elemental Burst | 3d8 AoE matching element damage (1/combat) |
| 40 | Primordial Awakening | Elemental form: immune to physical, 2d10/turn, 3 turns (48h cooldown) |

**Profession Bonuses:** +25% speed and +20% quality on element-specific crafting, +15% yield on element-specific gathering

**Best Classes:** Mage (Elementalist), Cleric (Paladin for Fire/Earth), Ranger (for Air)

**Playstyle:** Specialists. Each Genasi sub-race excels at one crafting niche. Fire Genasi make the best smelters and blacksmiths outside of Dwarves. Water Genasi are second only to Tieflings in alchemy. Earth Genasi rival Goliaths in mining. Air Genasi are unique enchanting/fletching specialists. Elemental Infusion at 10 adds elemental damage to everything you craft, making Genasi goods distinctive and valuable.

---

## Revenant -- The Deathless

> *"Fully conscious, fully sentient, and fully annoyed at being perpetually stuck between life and death."*

| Stat | STR | DEX | CON | INT | WIS | CHA |
|------|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|
| Modifier | +2 | +0 | +3 | +1 | +2 | -2 |

**Trait: Deathless** -- Extraordinarily hard to kill, but unsettling to the living.

**Homeland:** The Ashenmoor
**Starting Towns:** Ashenmoor
**Exclusive Zone:** Ashenmoor Deadlands

**What Makes Revenants Unique:**

The defining Revenant mechanic is **death costs half as much**. When any other race dies, they lose gold, XP, and equipment durability. Revenants lose only 50% of that penalty and respawn in 50% of the time at 50% HP. This makes Revenants the best race for high-risk content -- if you are going to die a lot (fighting above your level, exploring dangerous zones, PvP), Revenant minimizes the punishment.

The trade-off: -25% cooking quality (the dead have poor taste) and **-20% reputation gain** with all races (the living find you unsettling).

**Racial Abilities:**
| Level | Ability | Effect |
|-------|---------|--------|
| 1 | Undying | 50% respawn time, 50% HP on respawn, 50% death penalty |
| 5 | Necrotic Resistance | Immune to necrotic damage and disease |
| 10 | Death's Insight | See HP percentage of all enemies and players |
| 15 | Life Drain | Melee attack that heals 50% of damage dealt (1/combat) |
| 25 | Undying Fortitude | Negate a killing blow entirely (1/combat) |
| 40 | Army of the Dead | Summon 3 skeletal warriors for 1 combat (48h cooldown) |

**Profession Bonuses:** +25% herbalism yield, +20% alchemy quality, +15% mining yield, +15% hunting yield
**Profession Penalties:** -25% cooking quality, -20% reputation gain

**Best Classes:** Warrior (Berserker), Mage (Necromancer), Cleric (Paladin)

**Playstyle:** The unkillable. Revenants combine Undying (halved death penalty), Undying Fortitude (negate one killing blow per combat), and Necrotic Resistance (immune to an entire damage type) to create the most death-resistant character in the game. The Necromancer Mage / Revenant combination is thematically perfect and mechanically strong -- Life Drain stacks with Necromancer's Life Drain for massive sustain. Army of the Dead at 40 is one of the most powerful capstones, summoning 3 additional combatants.

# Part 10: Tips and Strategies

## New Player Checklist

Your first few hours in Aethermere will set the tone for your entire experience. Follow this checklist to get started on the right foot:

1. **Pick a Core race for your first character.** Humans, Dwarves, and Halflings are the most forgiving.
2. **Talk to the town elder.** Accept "The Awakening" quest for your first 100 XP.
3. **Complete "Proving Ground."** Kill Goblins and Giant Rats around your starting town. This gets you to level 2-3 quickly.
4. **Pick up daily quests.** Daily Hunt and Daily Gathering are available at level 1 and should be completed every day.
5. **Learn your first profession.** Mining, Herbalism, or Farming are great first choices -- they produce raw materials that are always in demand.
6. **Learn a crafting profession.** Pair it with your gathering: Mining + Smelting, or Herbalism + Alchemy.
7. **Sell surplus materials on the marketplace.** Even low-level materials sell. Build your gold reserve early.
8. **Invest in tools.** Better tools mean higher quality crafting. This pays for itself quickly.
9. **Reach level 10 and choose your specialization.** This is the most important decision after race and class.
10. **Join a guild.** The social and economic benefits of guild membership are significant.

## Best Race/Class Combinations

### A-Tier (Strong Synergy)

| Warforged | Warrior | Guardian | CON+3, Integrated Armor + Siege Mode = fortress |

## Best Profession Combinations

### For Maximum Gold

1. **Dwarf:** Mining + Smelting + Blacksmithing -- Mine deep ores, smelt them, forge Masterwork weapons. The entire chain benefits from racial bonuses.

2. **Halfling:** Cooking + Brewing + Trading -- Cook food, brew drinks, sell them on the marketplace with Silver Tongue. Trade Network at 25 opens arbitrage.

3. **Merfolk:** Fishing + Any Crafting + Trading -- Exclusive Deep Ocean resources sell at premium prices. You supply what no one else can.

4. **Tiefling:** Herbalism + Alchemy + Enchanting -- +30% alchemy quality and +20% enchanting quality make every potion and enchantment worth more.

### For Self-Sufficiency

1. **Human:** Mining + Blacksmithing + Leatherworking (use Adaptable Crafter for 4th: Enchanting) -- Craft your own weapons, armor, and enchantments.

2. **Elf:** Herbalism + Alchemy + Enchanting -- Gather your own herbs, make your own potions, enchant your own gear.

3. **Orc:** Hunting + Tanning + Leatherworking -- Kill beasts, process hides, make your own leather armor. Complete combat loop.

## Gold-Making Strategies

### Early Game (Level 1-10)

- Complete daily quests every day (275 XP + 55g minimum from Daily Hunt + Daily Gathering)
- Gather raw materials and sell them -- even common ore and herbs have buyers
- Avoid spending gold on marketplace gear until level 10; quest and monster drops are sufficient
- Do not buy potions; fight monsters at or below your level to avoid needing them

### Mid Game (Level 10-25)

- Focus on crafting quality: invest in tools and workshops
- Craft Fine/Superior items and sell them for 1.5x-2.5x base value
- Take bounty quests for high gold rewards
- PvP wagering becomes profitable if you are skilled -- 950g per 500g wager against same-level opponents
- Join a guild for access to guild quests (extra gold + reputation)

### Late Game (Level 25+)

- Exclusive zone farming: if you have an exclusive zone, your resources are irreplaceable
- Masterwork/Legendary crafting: items at these tiers sell for 4x-8x base value
- Political income: mayors collect tax revenue; use it wisely
- Trade arbitrage: Halflings with Trade Network can see all prices; buy where cheap, sell where expensive
- Build a workshop: level 3-5 workshops add +3 to +5 on quality rolls

## Common Mistakes

1. **Spreading stat points too thin.** Focus on 2-3 primary stats. A Warrior with 15 STR/15 CON will always beat one with 10 in everything.

2. **Ignoring professions.** Combat XP alone is not enough. Professions provide gold, equipment, and crafting XP that contributes to character leveling.

3. **Skipping daily quests.** 24 hours of missed dailies is 275+ XP and 55+ gold you can never recover. The compound effect over weeks is enormous.

4. **Fighting above your level without preparation.** Death penalties (gold/XP/durability loss) set you back significantly. Fight at or slightly below your level unless you have a specific reason.

5. **Undervaluing quality.** A Masterwork iron sword (4x value) costs the same raw materials as a Common one. The only difference is your profession level, tools, and workshop. Invest in quality.

6. **Not joining a guild.** Guild quests, treasury benefits, and social connections are too valuable to pass up. The 500g creation cost is shared if you join an existing guild for free.

7. **Playing an exotic race first.** Exotic races have powerful abilities but punishing trade-offs. Learn the game mechanics with a Core race, then reroll exotic.

## Advanced Strategies

### The Dwarf Mining Empire

Play a Dwarf Guardian Warrior with Mining + Smelting + Blacksmithing. At level 1, your Deep Mines access gives you ores no one else can reach. By level 10, Master Forger adds +3 to blacksmithing rolls. By level 15, Stonecunning adds +25% mining yield and +10% gem discovery. By level 25, Clan Loyalty buffs your entire Dwarf guild. You become the primary weapon supplier for your kingdom, fund a political campaign through your guild's economic power, and eventually run for Ruler.

### The Halfling Trade Network

Play a Halfling Thief Rogue. Silver Tongue (level 10) gives you 10% marketplace spread. Quick Fingers (passive +10% gold drops) and Trade Network (level 25, global price visibility) turn you into a master merchant. Pair with Cooking + Brewing + Trading professions. You never swing a sword -- you make money by buying cheap in one town and selling expensive in another, producing food buffs that are always in demand, and pilfering gold from monsters you grudgingly fight.

### The Revenant Necromancer

Play a Revenant Necromancer Mage. You have three lives: Undying (50% HP respawn), Undying Fortitude (negate killing blow), and Lichdom (50% HP revive). Between Life Drain (racial, 50% lifesteal) and Life Drain (Necromancer, 50% heal), you sustain through fights that would kill anyone else. At level 40, Army of the Dead summons 3 skeletal warriors while you blast Soul Harvest for AoE damage and healing. You are the raid boss.

### The Elf Enchanting Magnate

Play an Elf Enchanter Mage with Herbalism + Enchanting + Alchemy. Keen Senses (+20% rare resources), Arcane Affinity (+2 enchanting quality), and Ageless Knowledge (+15% XP for Enchanter, Herbalist, Scribe) create a self-sustaining enchanting powerhouse. Gather rare herbs, brew potions, enchant equipment. Spell Weaver (all cooldowns -1) makes you efficient in combat too. The Silent Wood crafting empire.

# Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Can I change my race or class after creation?**
A: No. Race and class are permanent choices. You can choose a different specialization by respeccing (at a cost), but your base race and class are locked. Choose carefully, or create a second character to try something different.

**Q: How many professions can I have?**
A: 3 by default. Humans with the Adaptable Crafter racial ability (level 15) can learn a 4th. Half-Elves who pick the Human ability via Versatile Heritage can also get a 4th.

**Q: What happens when my equipment breaks?**
A: When durability reaches 0, the item becomes unusable until repaired. Repair costs scale with the item's level and quality. Higher quality items (Fine through Legendary) have more durability and last longer, but cost more to repair. Keep spare equipment for extended adventures.

**Q: How does the marketplace tax work?**
A: The town mayor sets a tax rate between 0% and 25%. When you sell an item on that town's marketplace, the tax percentage is deducted from the sale price and goes to the town treasury. Shopping in low-tax towns saves gold. Halflings get 5% better prices on both buying and selling via Silver Tongue.

**Q: Can I travel anywhere from the start?**
A: Yes, but travel takes real time and routes follow predefined connections. You start in your racial homeland and must travel outward. During wartime, routes through enemy territory take 50% longer and enemy capitals are blocked entirely.

**Q: Is PvP optional?**
A: Yes. PvP is duel-based and requires both players to agree. You must accept a challenge to fight. There is no open-world PvP where you can be attacked without consent.

**Q: What is the level cap?**
A: There is no hard level cap. The XP curve continues scaling (Level x 100 per level). However, the highest-tier racial abilities and class capstones unlock at level 40, and the main story quest concludes around level 16. Levels beyond 40 provide stat points and skill points but no new ability unlocks.

**Q: How do I become mayor?**
A: Live in a town as a resident. When an election is called, nominate yourself. Town residents vote, and the candidate with the most votes wins. You can serve up to 3 consecutive terms before a mandatory break. To become a kingdom ruler, you must first be a mayor, then be elected by other mayors.

**Q: What is the best race for a first-time player?**
A: Human. The +1 to all stats means no weaknesses, the 4th profession slot (level 15) is unique and powerful, and the Verdant Heartlands is the safest starting region. Dwarf is a close second for players who want to focus on crafting. Halfling is excellent for economy-focused players.

**Q: Can different races work together?**
A: Absolutely, and the game is designed to encourage it. Dwarves mine ore that only they can reach, then sell it to Gnome jewelcrafters. Merfolk supply rare ocean materials to surface crafters. Firbolg herbalists trade with Tiefling alchemists. The racial exclusive zones and profession bonuses create natural trade dependencies that reward cooperation across races.

**Q: What are sub-races?**
A: Three races have sub-races that you choose at character creation:
- **Dragonborn** choose from 7 draconic ancestries (Red, Blue, White, Black, Green, Gold, Silver), each with a different element, breath shape, and resistance.
- **Beastfolk** choose from 6 clans (Wolf, Bear, Fox, Hawk, Panther, Boar), each with a bonus stat and special perk.
- **Genasi** choose from 4 elements (Fire, Water, Earth, Air), each with a bonus stat, element, resistance, and crafting specialty.

**Q: How do guild quests work?**
A: After joining a guild, you can accept guild quests from the guild menu. These are special quests that award reputation in addition to XP and gold. Reputation unlocks guild-specific benefits. There are currently 3 guild quests available.

**Q: Does quality matter for consumables?**
A: Yes. Higher quality potions heal more. Higher quality food gives stronger buffs and lasts longer (Halfling Feast Master doubles food buff duration). Higher quality poisons deal more damage over time. Quality always matters.

**Q: What happens to my stuff if my guild is disbanded?**
A: Only the guild leader can disband a guild. When disbanded, all members are removed from the guild. Any gold in the guild treasury is distributed (check with your guild leader before disbanding). Personal inventories are never affected.

**Q: How do I get titles?**
A: Titles are earned through achievements. For example, winning 50 PvE combats earns the "Veteran" title. Reaching level 10 earns "Adventurer". Reaching level 50 earns "Legend". Titles are displayed on your profile and visible to other players. See Part 6 for the full achievement list.

**Q: Can I play as a crafter and never fight?**
A: Mostly yes. Professions can be leveled entirely through gathering and crafting. However, the main story quests require combat, and some gathering areas are in dangerous regions. Many successful crafters hire mercenaries (or guild members) for protection while they gather in hostile territory. The Bard Diplomat specialization can even end fights peacefully with Diplomat's Gambit (50% chance).
